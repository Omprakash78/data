PREFACE    TO    PART   I
Tin:  work,  of  which  tlio  part  now  issued  is  a  first  instal- ment, has  been  compiled  from  notes  made  at  various  periods of  the  last  fourteen  years,  and  chiefly  during*  the  engagements of  teaching.  !Many  of  the  abbreviated  methods  and  mnemonic rules  are  in  the  form  in  which  I  originally  wrote  them  for  my pupils.
The  general  object  of  the  compilation  is,  as  the  title indicates,  to  present  within  a  moderate  compass  the  funda- mental theorems,  formulas,  and  processes  in  the  chief  branches of  pure  and  applied  mathematics.
Tlie  work  is  intended,  in  the  first  place,  to  follow  and supplement  the  use  of  tl,ic  ordinary  text-books,  and  it  is arranged  witli  tlie  view  of  assisting  tlie  student  in  the  task  of revision  of  book-w^ork.  To  this  end  I  have,  in  many  cases, merely  indicated  the  salient  points  of  a  demonstration,  or merely  referred  to  the  theorems  by  which  the  proposition  is proved.  I  am  convinced  that  it  is  more  beneficial  to  tlie student  to  recall  demonstrations  with  such  aids,  than  to  read and  re-read  them.  Let  them  be  read  once,  but  recalled  often. The  difference  in  the  effect  upon  the  mind  between  reading  a mathematical  demonstration,  and  originating  cue  wholly  or

partly,  is  very  great.  It  may  be  compared  to  tlic  difference between  the  pleasure  experienced,  and  interest  aroused,  when in  the  one  case  a  traveller  is  passively  conducted  through  the roads  of  a  novel  and  unexplored  country,  and  in  the  other case  he  discovers  the  roads  for  himself  with  the  assistance  of a  map.
In  the  second  place,  I  venture  to  hope  that  the  work, when  completed,  may  prove  useful  to  advanced  students  as an  aide-memoire  and  book  of  reference.  The  boundary  of mathematical  science  forms,  year  by  year,  an  ever  widening circle,  and  the  advantage  of  having  at  hand  some  condensed statement  of  results  becomes  more  and  more  evident.
To  the  original  investigator  occupied  with  abstruse  re- searches in  some  one  of  the  many  branches  of  mathematics,  a work  which  gathers  together  synoptically  the  leading  propo- sitions in  all,  may  not  therefore  prove  unacceptable.  Abler hands  than  mine  undoubtedly,  might  have  undertaken  the  task of  making  such  a  digest ;  but  abler  hands  might  also,  perhaps, be  more  usefully  emj^loycd, — and  with  this  reflection  I  have  the less  hesitation  in  commencing  the  work  myself.  The  design which  I  have  indicated  is  somewhat  comprehensive,  and  in relation  to  it  the  present  essay  may  be  regarded  as  tentative. The  degree  of  success  which  it  may  meet  with,  and  the suggestions  or  criticisms  which  it  may  call  forth,  will  doubt- Ic:  ■!  have  their  effect  on  the  subsequent  portions  of  the  work.
With  respect  to  the  abridgment  of  the  demonstrations,  I may  remark,  that  while  some  diffuseness  of  explanation  is  not only  allowable  but  very  desirable  in  an  initiatory  treatise, conciseness  is  one  of  the  chief  reciuiremcnts  in  a  work  intended
PREFACE.  V
for  tlio  piii-i)OSos  of  revision  and  rcfiTeiico  only.  In  order, liowever,  not  to  sacrifice  clearness  to  conciseness,  much  moro la])our  has  been  expended  upon  this  part  of  the  subject-matter of  the  book  than  will  at  first  sip^ht  be  at  all  evident.  The  only ])alpal)le  I'esult  lK'in<^  a  compression  of  the  text,  the  result  is so  far  a  neji^ative  one.  The  amount  of  compression  attained is  illustrated  in  the  last  section  of  the  present  part,  in  which moro  than  the  number  of  propositions  usually  given  in treatises  on  Geometrical  Conies  are  contained,  together  with the  figures  and  demonstrations,  in  the  s})ace  of  twenty-foui* pages.
The  foregoing  remarks  have  a  general  application  to  the work  as  a  whole.  With  the  view,  however,  of  making  the earlier  sections  more  acceptable  to  beginners,  it  will  be  found tliat,  in  those  sections,  important  principles  have  sometimes been  more  fully  elucidated  and  more  illustrated  by  exam})les, than  the  plan  of  the  work  would  admit  of  in  subsequent di\isions.
A  feature  to  which  attention  may  be  directed  is  the  uni- form system  of  reference  adopted  throughout  all  the  sections. AVithtlie  object  of  facilitating  such  reference,  the  articles  have been  numbered  progressively  from  the  commencement  in large  Clarendon  figures ;  the  breaks  which  will  occasionally be  found  in  these  numbers  having  been  purposely  made, in  order to  leave  room  for  the  insertion  of  additional  matter,  if  it  should be  re(piired  in  a  future  edition,  without  distui-bing  tlie  oi'iginal numbers  and  references.  With  the  same  object,  demonstrations and  examples  have  been  made  subordinate  to  enunciations  and formidie,  the  former  being  [)rinted  in  small,  the  latter  in  bold

type.  By  tliese  aids,  tlic  intordcpcndoncc  of  propositions  is more  reudily  sliown,  and  it  becomes  easy  to  trace  the  connexion Ijetwecn  theorems  in  different  branches  of  mathematics,  with- out the  loss  of  time  which  would  be  incurred  in  turning  to separate  treatises  on  the  subjects.  The  advantage  thus  gained will,  however,  become  more  apparent  as  the  work  proceeds.
The  Algebra  section  was  printed  some  years  ago,  and  does not  quite  correspond  mth  the  succeeding  ones  in  some  of the  particulars  named  above.  Under  the  pressure  of  other occupations,  this  section  moreover  was  not  properly  revised before  f>'oing  to  press.  On  that  account  the  table  of  errata will  be  found  to  apply  almost  exclusively  to  errors  in  that section ;  but  I  trust  that  the  hst  is  e:s.haustive.  Great  pains liave  been  taken  to  secure  the  accm^acy  of  the  rest  of  the volume.     Any  intimation  of  errors  will  be  gladly  received.
I  have  now  to  acknowledge  some  of  the  sources  from  which the  present  part  has  been  compiled.  In  the  Algebra,  Theory of  Equations,  and  Trigonometry  sections,  I  am  largely  in- debted to  Todhunter's  well-known  treatises,  the  accuracy  and completeness  of  which  it  would  be  superfluous  in  me  to  dwell upon.
In  the  section  entitled  Elementary  Geometry,  I  have  added to  simpler  propositions  a  selection  of  theorems  from  Town- send's  Modern  Geometiy  and  Salmon's  Conic  Sections.
In  Geometrical  Conies,  the  line  of  demonstration  followed agrees,  in  the  main,  with  that  adopted  in  Drew's  treatise  on  the subject.  I  am  inclined  to  think  that  the  method  of  that author  cannot  be  much  improved.  It  is  true  that  some  im- portant  properties    of   the  ellipse,  which  are  arrived  at  in

But  the  intcM-mediate  propositions  can- not on  that  account  be  dispenscnl  w  itli,  for  they  are  of  value  in th(Mns('lv(\^.  ]\Ioreov(>r,  tlie  nietliod  of  projection  applied  to Ili(>  hyperbola  is  not  so  successful;  because  a  pi-oj)erty  which lias  first  to  bo  proved  true  in  the  case  of  the  equilateral hyperbola,  might  as  will  be  proved  at  once  for  the  general  case. I  have  introduced  the  method  of  projection  but  spanngly, alwavs  giving  prefei'ence  to  a  demonstration  which  admits  of being  n])])li(Ml  in  the  same  identical  form  to  the  ellipse  and  to the  hyperbola.  The  remarkable  analogy  subsisting  between the  two  curves  is  thus  kept  prominently  before  the  reader.
The  account  of  the  C.  G.  S.  system  of  units  given  in  the preliminary  section,  has  been  compiled  from  a  valuable  con- tribution on  the  subject  by  Professor  Everett,  of  Belfast, published  by  the  Physical  Society  of  London.*  This  abstract, and  the  tables  of  physical  constants,  might  perhaps  have  found a  more  appropriate  place  in  an  after  part  of  the  work.  I  have, however,  introduced  them  at  the  commencement,  from  a  sense of  the  great  importance  of  the  rcfonu  in  the  selection  of  units of  measurement  Avhich  is  embodied  in  the  C  G.  S.  system, and  from  a  belief  that  the  student  cannot  be  too  early familiarized  with  the  same.
The  Factor  Table  wliich  folluAvs  is,  to  its  limited  extent,  a rei)rint  of  Burckluirdt's  "  Tnhlr.^  ilrs  diviscurs,''  published  in

1814-17,  which  give  the  least  divisors  of  all  numbers  from  1 to  3,036,000.  In  a  certain  sense,  it  may  be  said  that  this  is the  only  sort  of  purely  mathematical  table  which  is  absolutely indispensable,  because  the  information  which  it  gives  cannot be  supplied  by  any  process  of  direct  calculation.  The  loga- rithm of  a  number,  for  instance,  may  be  computed  by  a formula.  Not  so  its  prime  factors.  These  can  only  bo arrived  at  through  the  tentative  process  of  successive  divisions by  the  prime  numbers,  an  operation  of  a  most  deterrent  kind when  the  subject  of  it  is  a  liigh  integer.
A  table  similar  to  and  in  continuation  of  Burckhardt's  has recently  been  constructed  for  the  fourth  million  by  J.^Y.  L. Glaisher,  F.R.S.,  who  I  believe  is  also  now  engaged  in  com- pleting the  fifth  and  sixth  millions.  The  factors  for  the  seventh, eighth,  and  ninth  millions  were  calculated  previously  by  Dase and  Rosenberg,  and  pubhshed  in  1862-05,  and  the  tenth million  is  said  to  exist  in  manuscript.  The  history  of  the formation  of  these  tables  is  both  instructive  and  interesting.*
As,  however,  such  tables  are  necessarily  expensive  to  pur- chase, and  not  very  accessible  in  any  other  way  to  the  majority of  persons,  it  seemed  to  me  that  a  small  portion  of  them would  form  a  useful  accompaniment  to  the  present  volume. I  have,  accordingly,  introduced  the  first  eleven  pages  of  Burckh- ardt's tables,  which  give  the  least  factors  of  tlie  first  100,000 integers  nearly.    Each  double  page  of  the  table  here  pi-iiUed  is

In  addition  to  tlie  autliors  already  named,  tlie  following
treatises  have  been  consulted — Algebras,  by  AYood,  Bourdon,

Articles   2G0,  431,  o69,  and  very  nearly  all  the  examples,
are  original.     The  latter  have  been  framed  with  great  care,  in
order  that  they  might  illustrate  the  propositions  as  completely
as  possible.

INTRODUCTION.
The  Ccnthnctrv-Grammc-Second  system  of  units.
Notation. — The  decimal  measures  of  length  are  the  kilo- metre^ hectometre,  decametre,  metre,  decimetre,  centimetre, miUimetre.  The  same  prefixes  are  used  with  the  litre  and gramme  for  measures  of  capacity  aud  volume;  ^'^''f^
Also,  10'  metres  is  deuouiinated  a  metre-><ei:en;  10"^  metres, a  seventh-metre  ;  lO^f  grammes,  a  gramme-fy'tcen  ;  and  so  on.
A  o;rainme-imttwH  is  also  called  a  megagramme ;  and  a milliontli-gramme,  a  microgramme ;  and  similarly  "with  other measures.
Definitions. — The  C.  G.  S.  system  of  units  refers  idl  pliy- sical  measurements  to  the  Centimetre  (cm.),  tlie  (Jramme  (gm.), and  the  Second  (sec.)  as  the  units  of  length,  mass,  and  time.
Tlie  quadrant  of  a  meridian  is  approximately  a  metre- seven.  More  exactly,  one  metre  =  3-28U8Gyi  feet  =  89-370-i-j2 inches.
The  Gramme  is  the  Unit  of  mass,  and  the  weight  of  a gramme  is  the  Uiiit  qftveight,  being  approximately  the  wciglit of  a  cubic  centimetre  of  water;  more  exactly,  1  gm.  = 15-432:U1)  grs.
The  jL/f;v' is  a  cubic  decimetre:  but  one  cubic  centimetre is  the  C.  G.  S.  Unit  of  volume.
1  litre  =  -035317  cubic  feet  =  '22000(37  gallons.
The  l)i/ne  (dn.)  is  the  Unit  of  force,  and  is  the  force  wliicli, in  one  second  generates  in  a  gramme  of  matter  a  velocity  of one  centimetre  per  second.
The  7'i/v/ is  the  Unit  of  worlc  and  energg,  and  is  the  work done  by  a  dyne  in  the  distance  of  one  centimetre.
The  absolute  Unit  (f  atmospltcric pressure  is  one  meg:ulyno })er  square  centimetre  =  71«'0G1  cm.,  or  2!>"."j14  in.  of  mercurial column  at  0"  at  London,  where  ^  =  y8ri7  dynes.
Elasticitij  of  Volume  =  l\  is  the  pressure  per  unit  area upon  a  body  divided  by  the  cubic  dilatation.

MATHEMATICAL  TABLES.
Rigidity  =  n,  is  the  shearing  stress  divided  hj  the  angle of  the  shear.
Young's  Modiihifi  =  M,  is  the  longitudinal  stress  divided by  the  elongation  produced,  =  9nh  -h  (3/j  +  ??).
Tenacity  is  the  tensile  strength  of  the  substance  in  dynes per  square  centimetre.
The  Gramme-degree  is  the  Unit  of  heat,  and  is  the  amount of  heat  required  to  raise  by  1°  C.  the  temperature  of  1  gramme of  water  at  or  near  0°.
Thermal  capacifi/  of  a  body  is  the  increment  of  heat divided  by  the  increment  of  temperature.  When  the  incrc- raonts  are  small,  this  is  the  thermal  capacity  at  the  given temperatu"e.
Specific  heat  is  the  thermal  capacity  of  unit  mass  of  the body  at  the  given  temperature.
The  Electrostatic  iinit  is  the  quantity  of  electricity  which repels  an  equal  quantity  at  the  distance  of  1  centimetre  mth the  force  of  1  dyne.
The  Electromagnetic  unit  of  quantity  =  3  X  1 0^''  electro- static units  approximately.
The  Unit  of  potential  is  the  potential  of  unit  quantity  at unit  distance.
The  Ohm  is  the  common  electromagnetic  unit  of  resistance, and  is  approximately  =  \(f  G.  G.  S.  units.
The  Volt  is  the  unit  of  electromotive  force,  and  is  =  10^ C.  G.  S.  units  of  potential.
The  Weber  is  the  unit-  of  current,  being  the  current  due  to an  electromotive  force  of  1  Volt,  with  a  resistance  of  1  Ohm. It  is  =  -j^  C.  G.  S.  unit.

BURCKTIARDT'S  FACTOR  TABLES.
For  all  M.'.Mr.KKS  FJiOM  1  to  9'JOOO.
Explanation. — Tlic  tables  give  the  least  divisor  of  cvciy number  from  1  up  to  99000 :  but  numbers  divisible  by  2,  3, or  6  are  not  printed.  All  tlie  digits  of  the  number  whoso divisor  is  sought,  excepting  the  units  and  tens,  will  be  found in  one  of  the  three  rows  of  larger  figures.  The  two  remaining digits  will  be  found  in  the  left-haiid  column.  The  least  divisor will  then  be  found  in  the  column  of  the  first  named  digits,  and in  the  row  of  the  units  and  tens.
If  the  number  be  prime,  a  cipher  is  printed  in  the  place  of its  least  divisor.
The  numbers  in  the  first  left-hand  column  are  not  conse- cutive. Those  are  omitted  which  have  2,  3,  or  5  for  a  divisor. Since  2"-. 3. 5"^  =  300,  it  follows  that  this  column  of  numl)er3 will  re-appear  in  the  same  order  after  each  multiple  of  300  is reached.
Mode  of  using  TnE  Tables. — If  the  number  whose  prime factors  are  required  is  divisible  by  2  or  5,  the  fact  is  evident upon  inspection,  and  the  dinsion  must  be  effected.  The quotient  then  becomes  the  number  whose  factors  are  required. If  this  number,  being  within  the  range  of  the  tables,  is  yet not  given,  if  is  dirisihle  by  3.  Di\'iding  by  3,  we  refer  to  the tables  again  for  the  new  quotient  and  its  least  factor,  and  so  on.
Ex.\Mrr,ES.  — Required  the  prime  factors  of  3101-55.
Dividinrr  by  5,  the  quotient  is  G2031.  This  number  is  within  the  range of  the  tables.  But  it  is  not  found  printed.  Therefore  3  is  a  divisor  of  it. Dividing  by  3,  the  quotient  is  20G77.  The  table  gives  23  for  the  least  factor of  2ftr)77.      Dividing  by  23,  the  quotient  is  SW.
The  table  gives  2i»  for  tlie  least  factor  of  H'.tO.  Dividing  by  20,  the  quo- tient is  31,  a  prime  number.     Therefore   31015-3  =  3.5.23.20.31.
Again,  roipiired  tiie  divisors  of  02881.  The  table  gives  203  for  the  least divisor.  Dividing  by  it,  the  quotient  is  317.  Referring  to  the  tables  lor  31 7, a  cipher  is  found  in  tbe  place  of  the  least  divisor,  and  this  signifies  that  317 is  a  prime  nundjer.
Tlitrefore  02S81  =  203  X  317,  the  product  of  two  primes.
It  may  be  remarked  that,  to  have  resolved  02881  into  these  factors  with- out the  aid  of  tiio  tables  by  the  method  of  Art.  3G0,  would  have  iuvolved fifty-nine  fruitless  trial  divisions  by  prime  uumbei-a.

HIGHEST   COMMON

30  Rule. — To  find  the  highest  common  factor  of  two  ex- pressions :  Divide  the  one  'which  is  of  the  highest  dimension  hy the  other,  rejecting  first  any  factor  of  either  exjrression  which is  not  also  a  factor  of  the  other.  Operate  in  the  same  manner ujjon  the  remainder  and  the  divisor ,  and  continue  the  process until  there  is  no  remainder.  The  last  divisor  ivill  he  the highest  common  factor  required.

Explanation. — The  cube  root  of  8  is  2,  the  first  term  of  the  result.
Place  3x2  =  6  in  the  first  column  I.,  3x2^  =  12  in  column  II.,  and  2*=  8 in  III.,  changing  its  sign  for  subtraction.
—  36-f-12  =  —  3,  the  second  term  of  the  result.
Put  -3  in  I.;  (6-3)  X  (-3)  gives  -18  +  9  for  II.
(12  — 18  +  9)  X  3  (changing  sign)  gives  36  —  54  +  27  for  III.     Then  add.
Put  twice  (  —  3),  the  term  last  found,  in  I.,  and  the  square  of  it  in  II. Add  the  two  last  rows  in  I.,  and  the  three  last  in  II.
12-T-12  gives  1,  the  thu'd  term  of  the  result.
Put  1  in  col.  I.,  (6-9  +  1)  xl  gives  6-9  +  1  for  col.  IT.
(12  — 36  +  33- 9  +  1)  X  1  gives  the  same  for  III.  Change  the  signs,  and add,  and  the  work  is  finished.
The  foregoing  process  is  bub  a  slight  variation  of  Horner's rule  for  solving  an  equation  of  any  degree.     See  (533).

Elder's  proof.— Let  the  expansion  of  (1 +.'«)",  as  in  (125), be  called /(7i).     Then  it  may  be  proved  by  Induction  that  the
equation  f{'>n)Xf{n)  =f{m  +  n)       (1)
is  true  when  m  and  n  are  integers,  and  therefore  universally true  ;  because  the  form  of  an  algebraical  product  is  not  altered by  changing  the  letters  involved  into  fractional  or  negative quantities.     Hence
/(m  +  ?i+j9  +  &c.)  =fim)Xf{n)Xf(p),  &c.
Put  7n  =  71=  2^  =  &c.  to  Jc  terms,  each  equal  —,  and  the
theorem  is  proved  for  a  fractional  index.
Again,  put  —n  for  m  in  (1) ;  thus,  whatever  n  may  be, f{-^i)Xf{n)=f{0)  =  l, which  proves  the  theorem  for  a  negative  index.

PARTIAL   FRACTIONS.
In  the  resolution  of  a  fraction  into  partial  fractions  four cases  present  tlieniselves,  \\]\\c\\  arc  illustrated  in  tlie  follow- ing examples.
78  ALGEBRA.
235  First. — When  there  are  no  repeated  factors  in  the  de- nominator of  the  given  fraction.
3a;— 2
Ex. — To  resolve   :r—,   -—   —  into  partial  fractions.

Sx-2  =  A(x-2)(!c-S)-\-B(x-S)(x-l)  +  C{x-l)(x-2).
Since  A,  B,  and  C  do  not  contain  x,  and  this  equation  is  true  for  all  values of  X,  put  x  =  l  ;  then
3-2  =  ^(1-2)  (1-3),  from  whicli  A  =  ^. Similarly,  if  x  be  put  =  2,  we  have
6-2  =  i?  (2-3)  (2-1)  ;  .-.     B  =  -4 ;
and,  putting  a;  =  3,

236  Secondly. — When  there  is  a  repeated  factor.
Ex. — Eesolve  into  partial  fractions  i- — -.,„'       j!- ^  (a;— 1)^(33  +  2)

These  forms  are  necessary  and  sufficient.     Multiplying  up,  we  have
7x'-lOx'  +  6x  =  A  ix-\-2)  +B  (x-1)  ix  +  2)  +  C  (x-iy(x  +  2)  +D  (x-iy
  (I).
Makea;  =  l;         .'.     7-10  +  6  =  ^(1  +  2);  .-.     ^  =  1.
Substitute  this  valne  of  A  in  (1)  ;  thus
7x'-lOx'  +  5x-2  ^  B  (x-].){.v  i2)  +  C (x-iy(x  +  2)+D  (x-iy.
Divide  by  a;  —  1 ;  thus
7x'-Sx  +  2  =  B(x  +  2)  +  C(x-l)(x  +  2)+D(x-iy   (2).
Make  X  =  1  again,     7 -3  +  2  =  J?  (1  +  2)  ;         .-.     B  =  2.
Substitute  this  value  of  B  in  (2),  and  we  have
7a;*-5a;-2  =  G  (x-l)  (x  +  2) +D  (x-iy.
Divide  by  .T-l,  7a;  +  2  =  G  (x  +  2)+D  (x-l)   (3).
Put  a;  =  1  a  thiwl  time,     7  +  2=  C  (1+2);      .-.    C  =  3.

237     Thirdly.— When  there  is  a  quadratic  factor  of  imaginary roots  not  repeated.
Ex.— Resolve  ,t— tw^2-. — ,  ix  into  partial  fractions.
Here  we  must  assume

too'ether  two  simple  fractions,  such  as  — —-  ^   r~,-
°  ^  x  +  b      x  +  d
Multij)l}iiig  up,  we  have  the  equation
1  =  (Ax  +  B)  (x'  +  x  +  l)  +  {Cx  +  D)  (x'  +  l)    (1).
Let  a;-  +  l  =  0;         z.     x^  = —I.
Substitute  this  value  of  x-  in  (1)  repeatedly ;  thus
1  =  (Ax  +  B)  X  =  Ax'  +  Bx  =  -A  +  Bx  ; or  Bx-A-l  =  0.
Equate  coefficients  to  zero ;      .'.     5  =  0,
^  =  -1. Again,  let  ar  +  .r  +  l=0;
.-.     x-=-x-l. Substitute  this  value  of  x^  repeatedly  in  (1)  ;  thus
1  =  {Cx  +  D)  i-x)  =  -Cx'-Dx  =  Cx  +  C-Dx- or  (G-D)x  +  C-l=0.
Equate  coefficients  to  zero  ;  thus    ^ '  =  1,
1)=  1.

In  the  first  place,  to  determine  A  and  B,  equate  rt;-— 4a;  +  8  to  zero  ;  thus a;2=4a;-8.
Substitute  this  value  of  x-  repeatedly  in  (1),  as  in  the  previous  example, until  the  first  power  of  x  alone  remains.     The  resulting  equation  is
40a; -103=  (17.4  +  65)  a? -48^ -75.
Equating  coefficients,  we  obtain  two  equations
17^  +  65=    40  )       f  ..  ,      A  =  2
48^  +  75  =  103)'     ^^«--^^«^^     B  =  l.
Next,  to  determine  0  and  D,  substitute  these  values  of  A  and  5  in  (1) ; the  equation  will  then  be  divisible  by  a;^— 4a;  +  8.  Divide,  and  the  resulting equation  is
0  =  2x  +  l3+{Cx  +  B+(Ex  +  F)(x'-4x  +  8)]  (x  +  iy
+  {G  +  H(x  +  l)]{x'-4x  +  8y     (2).
Equate  a;'-  — 4a; +  8  again  to  zero,  and  proceed  exactly  as  before,  when finding  A  and  B.
Next,  to  determine  E  and  F,  substitute  the  values  of  (7  and  D,  last  found in  equation  (2)  ;  divide,  and  proceed  as  before.
Lastly,  G  and  H  are  determined  by  equating  a'  +  l  to  zero  successively, as  in  Example  2.

304  =  llOp  +  402  +  14r  k         p  =  G,     7  =  - 1 1,     r  =  6. 854  =  304;j+110g  +  40rJ Hence  the  Scale  of  Relation  is  1  — 6.«  +  ll.r  —  6.r^.

256      To  obtain  more  terms  of  the  series,  we  may  use  the  Scale  of  Relation  ; tlius  the  7th  term  will  be

257     To  find  the  general  term,  S  must  be  decomposed  into l)artial  fractions;  thus,  by  the  method  of  (2'35),

  —    =-3-3.c-3.r  -   -Sx".
Hence  the  general  term  involving  x"  is
(;3'>  +  2''»'-3)x''. And  by  this  formula  we  can  write  the  "  last  terms"  required  in  (2.")3),  and so  obtain  the  sum  of  any  finite  number  of  terms  of  the  given  series.  Also, by  the  same  formula  we  can  calculate  the  successive  terms  at  the  beginning of  the  series.  In  the  present  case  this  mode  will  be  more  expeditious  than that  of  employing  the  Scale  of  Relation.
258  If 5  in  decomposing  -<S'  into  partial  fractions  for  the  sake of  obtaining  the  general  term,  a  quadratic  factor  ^vitli  ima- ginary roots  sliould  occur  as  a  denominator,  tlie  same  method must  be  pursued,  for  the  imaginary  quantities  will  disappear in  the  final  result.  In  this  case,  however,  it  is  more  con- venient to  employ  a  general  formula.  Sup[)ose  the  fraction which  gives  rise  to  the  imaginary  roots  to  be
L-\-Mx    _    L-\-Mx

q  =  a—ij^y  where  i  =  v  —1.

If,  uow,  the  above  fraction  be  resolved  into  two  partial fractions  in  the  ordinary  way,  and  if  these  fractions  be  ex- panded separately  by  the  Binomial  Theorem,  and  that  part  of tlie  general  term  furnislied  by  these  two  expansions  written out,  still  retaining  j)  and  r/,  and  if  the  imaginary  values  of  p and  q  be  then  substituted,  it  will  be  found  that  the  factor  will disappear,  and  that  the  result  may  be  enunciated  as  follows.

261     If  certain  tirst  terms  only  of  the  series  be  given,  a  scale of  relation  may  be  found  which  shall   produce  a  recurring
BECUBRINQ   Sl^RII'JS.  87
series  whose  first  terms  arc  those  given.  The  method  is exemplified  in  ('255).  The  innnber  of  niikiiowii  coefficients j),  </,  r,  &c.  to  be  assumed  for  the  scale  of  relation  must  be equal  to  half  the  number  of  the  given  terms  of  the  series,  if that  number  be  even.  If  tlie  nund^er  of  given  terras  be  odd, it  may  he  made  even  by  })refixing  zero  for  the  first  term  of the  series.
262  Since  this  method  may,  however,  produce  zero  values for  one  or  more  of  the  last  coefiicients  in  the  scale  of  relation, it  may  be  advisable  in  practice  to  deteruiine  a  scale  from  the first  two  terms  of  the  series,  and  if  that  scale  does  not  jn-oduce the  following  terms,  we  may  try  a  scale  determined  from  the first  four  terms,  and  so  on  until  the  true  scale  is  arrived  at.
If  an  indefinite  nnmber  of  terms  of  the  series  be  given, we  may  find  whether  it  is  recurring  or  not  by  a  rule  of Lagrange's.
263  Let  the  series  be
S=  A  +  ]Jx  +  G.r  -h  Dx'  -f-  &c.
Divide  unity  by  S  as  far  as  two  terms  of  the  quotient,  wliicli will  be  of  the  form  p-\-qx,  and  write  the  remainder  in  the  form /S'V,  S'  being  another  indefinite  series  of  the  same  form  as  S.
Next,  divide  S  by  S'  as  far  as  two  terms  of  the  quotient, and  write  the  remainder  in  the  form  S"x-.
Again,  divide  /S"  by  S'",  and  proceed  as  before,  and  repeat this  process  until  there  is  no  remainder  after  one  of  the divisions.  The  series  will  then  be  proved  to  be  a  recurring series,  and  the  order  of  the  series,  that  is,  the  degree  of  tlie scale  of  relation,  will  be  the  same  as  the  number  of  divisions which  have  been  effected  in  the  process.
KxAMi'LK. —  To  determine  whether  the  series  1,  o,  (i,  10,  15,  '21,  28,  .'U), 45,  ...  is  recurring  or  not.

407  The  number  of  roots  of /(.^')  is  equal  to  the  degree  of the  equation.
408  Imaginary  roots  must  occur  in  pairs  of  the  form
a  +  /3v/^,     a-i3\/^.
The  quadratic  factor  corresponding  to  these  roots  will then  have  real  coefficients ;  for  it  will  be

409  If /(■'«)  be  of  an  odd  degree,  it  has  at  least  one  real  root
of  the  opposite  sign  to  p,j.
Thus  a;^  — 1  =  0  lias  at  least  one  positive  root.
410  If /('O  ^Q  of  an  even  degi^oe,  and  jhi  negative,  there  is at  least  one  positive  and  one  negative  root.
Thus  a;'*— 1  has  +1  and  —I  for  roots.
411  If  several  terms  at  the  beginning  of  the  equation  are  of one  sign,  and  all  the  rest  of  another,  there  is  one,  and  only one,  positive  root.
Thus  x^  +  2x*-\-Sx^  +  x'^  —  5x—4<  =  0  has  only  one  positive  root.
412  If  all  the  terms  are  positive  there  is  no  positive  root.
413  If  all  the  terms  of  an  even  order  are  of  one  sign,  and all  the  rest  are  of  another  sign,  there  is  no  negative  root,

Thus  x*  +  x^  +  l  =  0  has  no  real  root,  and  x'^  +  x^  +  x  =  0  has  no  real  rout but  zero.  In  this  last  equation  there  is  no  absolute  term,  because  such  a terra  would  involve  the  zero  power  o(  x,  which  is  even,  and  by  hypothesis  is wanting.

419  Wlien  all  the  roots  of  f{.r)  are  real,  the  number  of positive  roots  is  equal  to  the  number  of  changes  of  sign  in f{.r) ;  and  the  number  of  negative  roots  is  equal  to  the  number of  changes  of  sign  in/(— .r).
420  Thus,  it  being  known  that  the  roots  of  the  equation
a;*-10.t''  +  3o.c2-50.c  +  24  =  0 are  all  real ;  the  number  of  positive  roots  will  be  equal  to  the  number  of changes  of  sign,  which  is  four.     Also  f(—x)  =x*+lOx'^  +  3bx-  +  50x  +  2i!  =  0, and  since  there  is  no  change  of  sign,  there  is  consequently,  by  the  rule,  no negative  root.
421  If  the  degree  of /(./•)  exceeds  the  number  of  changes  of sign  in  f{x)  and  /(—a;)  together,  by  /t,  there  are  at  least  /j. imaginary  roots.
422  If,  between  two  terms  in /(,/■)  of  the  same  sign,  there be  an  odd  number  of  consecutive  terms  wanting,  then  there must  be  at  least  one  more  than  that  number  of  imaginary roots ;  and  if  the  missing  terms  lie  between  terms  of  different

Thus,  in  the  cubic  equation  x^  +  4x  —  7  =  0,  there  must  be  two  imaginary roots.
And  in  the  equation  x°—l  =■  0  there  arc,  for  certain,  four  imaginary  roots.
423     If  an  even  number  of  consecutive  terms  be  wanting  in f{x),  there  is  at  least  the  same  number  of  imaginary  roots.
Thus  the  equation  x^  +  1  —  0  has  four  terms  absent ;  and  therefore  four imaginary  roots  at  least.

That  these  remainders are  the  required  eoeflicients is  seen  by  inspecting  the form  of  the  equation  (420) ; for  if  that  equation  bo  di- vided by  x  —  a  =  II  repeat- edly, these  remainders  aro obviously  produced  when a  =  2.

460  In  employing  this  method,  limits  of  the  roots  may  first be  found,  and  divisors  chosen  between  those  limits.
461  Also,  to  lessen  the  number  of  trial  divisors,  take  any integer  m ;  then  any  divisor  a  of  the  last  term  can  be  rejected if  a  —  m  does  not  divide /(///).
In  practice  take  ///  =  -f-1  and  —  1 .
To  find  wliether  any  of  the  roots  determiiK'd  as  above  are repeated,  divide  f{x)  by  the  factors  correspijndiTig  to  them, and  then  applv  tlie  method  of  divisors  to  the  resulting  ecpiation.
124  THEORY  OF  EQUATIONS.
Example. — Take  the  equation
Putting  X  =  1,  we  find/(l)  =  —24.     The  divisors  of  144  are
1,     2,     3,     4,     G,     8,     9,     12,     IG,     24,  &c. The  values  of  n  —  m  (since  rii  =  l)  are  therefore
0,     1,     2,     3,     5,     7,     8,     11,     15,     23,  &c.
Of  these  last  numbers  only  1,  2,  3,  and  8  will  divide  24.  Hence  2,  3,  4,  and
9  are  the  only  divisors  of  144  wliich  it  is  of  use  to  try.  The  only  integral roots  of  the  equation  will  be  found  to  be  ±2  and  ±  3.
462  If  /('^')  and  F{X)  have  common  roots,  they  are  con- tained in  the  greatest  common  measure  of /(a:)  and  F{X).
463  If  /(■'')  l^as  for  its  roots  a,  (p  {a),  h,  (jt  {b)  amongst  others  ; then  the  equations /(.*)  =  0  and/[(^(A')j  =  0  have  the  common roots  a  and  h.
464  But,  if  all  the  roots  occur  in  pairs  in  this  ^vay,  these equations  coincide.
For  example,  suppose  that  each  pair  of  roots,  a  and  b,  satisfies  the  equation a  +  h  =  2r.  We  may  then  assume  a  —  b  =  2z.  Therefore/ (2 +  r)  =  0.  This equation  involves  only  even  powers  of  z,  and  may  be  solved  for  z'.
465  Otherwise:  Let  a&  =  z ;  then  /(;«)  is  divisible  by  {x  —  a){x  —  l) =  x^  —  2rx  +  z.  Perform  the  division  until  a  remainder  is  obtained  of  the form  Px  +  Q,  where  P  and  Q  only  involve  z.
The  equations  P  =  0,  Q  =  0  determine  z,  by  (462)  ;  and  a  and  I  arc  found from  a  +  b  =  2r,  ab  =  z.

(1)  That  /„,  (ft')  cannot  be  zero;  for,  if  it  were,  /'('^O  ^^^ /i  (x)  would  have  a  common  factor,  and  therefore  /(<^')  would have  equal  roots,  by  (432).
(2)  Two  consecutive  functions,  after  the  first,  cannot vanish  together  ;  for  this  would  make/*„  (x)  zero.
(;3)  AVhen  any  function,  after  the  first,  vanishes,  the  two adjacent  ones  have  contrary  signs.
509  If,  as  X  increases,  f(x)  passes  through  the  value  zero, StnrrrC s  Junctions  lose  one  change  of  sign.
For,  before ./'(-O  tf^kes  the  value  zero, /(a-)  and/,  {x)  have  contrary  signs, and  afterwards  tliey  have  the  same  sign;  as  may  be  shewn  by  making  h small,  and  changing  its  sign  in  the  expansion  off{x  +  li),  by  (420).

Let  P  (X)  denote  the  number  of  double  permanences. Then  P  (X)  ~  P  [fi)  is  either  equal  to  the  number  of  roots of /(ft'),  or  surpasses  that  number  by  an  even  integer.
Note. — The  first  series  may  be  multiplied  by  [n_,  and  will then  stand  thus,
/«(X),    /-^X),     [2/«-2(X),     [l/"-^(^)-h/W-
The  second  series  may  be  reduced  to
On{^),    r/„_,(x),    r/„_,(x)...rr(x),
where        G,  (X)  =  {/'•  (X)}^  -  '^y^^  f-'  (A)  f^'  (X).

ti'ying  5  instead  of  4.     This  gives  A.,  with  a  minus  sign,  thereby  pi-oving  the existence  of  a  root  between  24  and  2-5.  The  new  coetficieuts  are  A.^,  B.^,  C.,,  D.^.
—  Y?  gives  1  for  the  next  figure  of  the  root.
Affix  ciphers  as  before,  and  diminish  the  roots  by  1,  distinguishing  the new  coefficients  as  A^,  B^,  C^,  D^.
Note  that  at  every  stage  of  the  work  A  and  B  must  preserve  their  signs unchanged.  If  a  change  of  sign  takes  place  it  shews  that  too  hirge  a  figure has  been  tried.
To  abridge  the  calculation  pi'ocecd  thus : — After  a  certain  number  of figures  of  the  root  have  been  obtained  (in  this  example  four),  instead  of adding  ciphers  cut  ott"  one  digit  from  B^,  two  from  C'^,  and  three  from  D^. This  amounts  to  the  same  thing  as  adding  the  ciphers,  and  then  dividing each  number  by  10000.
Continue  the  work  with  the  numbers  so  reduced,  and  cut  off  digits  in  like manner  at  each  stage  until  the  D  and  C  columns  have  disappeared.
Aj  and  Bj  now  alone  remain,  and  six  additional  figures  of  the  root  are determined  correctly  by  the  division  of  A^  by  By.
To  find  the  other  root  which  lies  between  2  and  3,  we  proceed  as  follows  : — After  diminishing  the  roots  by  2,  try  G  for  the  next  figure.  This  gives  Jj negative;  7  does  the  same,  but  8  makes  J.,  positive.  That  is  to  say,  f{2'7) is  negative,  and/ (2'8)  positive.  Therefore  a  root  exists  between  2*7  and 2-8,  and  its  value  may  be  approximated  to,  in  the  manner  shewn.
Throughout    this    last   calculation   A    will   preserve  the  negative  sign.
Observe  also  that  the  trial  number  for  the  next  figure  of  the  root  given  at
f(c) each  stagfe  of  the  process  by  the  formula  —    ,     {,  will  in  this  case  be  always

The  coefficients  of  the  constituents  are  determinants  of the  next  lower  order,  and  are  termed  minors  of  the  original determinant.  Thus,  the  first  determinant  above  is  the  minor of  ^3  in  the  second  determinant.  It  is  denoted  by  C^.  So  the minor  of  %  is  denoted  by  vli,  and  so  on.

556  The  number  of  constituents  is  n^.
Tlie  number  of  elements  in  the  complete  determinant  is  [?^^.
557  The  first  or  leading  element  is  aih.,<\  ...  /„.  Any element  may  be  derived  from  the  first  by  permutation  of  the suffixes.
The  sign  of  an  element  is  +  or  —  according  as  it  has been  obtained  from  the  diagonal  element  by  an  even  or  odd number  of  permutations  of  the  suffixes.
Hence  the  following  rule  for  determining  the  sign  of  an element.
RuT.E. — Take  the  suffixes  in  order,  and  put  them  hach  to their  places  in  the  first  element.  Let  m  he  the  whole  number of  places  passed  over  ;  then  (  — 1)"*  "'^7/  give  the  sign  required.

In  all,  seven  places;  therefore  (—1)'  =  —1   gives  the  sign  required.
558  n  two  suffixes  in  any  element  be  transi)o.^ed,  the  sign of  the  element  is  changed.
Half  of  the  elements  are  plus,  and  half  are  minus.
559     The  elements  are  not  altered  ])y  changing  the  rows  into columns.
If  two  rows  or  columns  are  transposed,   the  sign  of  tho

determinant  is  clianged.  Because  each  element  changes  its sign.
If  two  rows  or  columns  are  identical,  the  determinant vanishes.
560  If  all  the  constituents  but  one  in  a  row  or  column vanish,  the  determinant  becomes  the  product  of  that  con- stituent and  a  determinant  of  the  next  lower  order.
561  A  cyclical  interchange  is  effected  by  n  —  \  successive transpositions  of  adjacent  rows  or  columns,  until  the  top  row has  been  brought  to  the  bottom,  or  the  left  column  to  the right  side.     Hence
A  cyclical  interchange  changes  the  sign  of  a  determinant of  an  even  order  only.
The  r*^  row  may  be  brought  to  the  top  by  r— 1  cyclical interchanges.
562  If  each  constituent  in  a  row  or  column  be  multiplied by  the  same  factor,  the  determinant  becomes  multiphed  by  it.
If  each  constituent  of  a  row  or  column  is  the  sum  of  m terms,  the  compound  determinant  becomes  the  sum  of  m simple  determinants  of  the  same  order.
Also,  if  every  constituent  of  the  determinant  consists  of m  terms,  the  compound  determinant  is  resolvable  into  the  sum of  m^  simple  determinants.

I*ut  all  the  constituents  in  the  r^^  row  and  /.-^^  column  equal to  0,  and  then  make  r— 1  cyclical  interchanges  in  the  rows and  L  —  1  in  the  columns,  and  multiply  by  (_iy'-+^)(«-i).

The  process  is  facilitated  by  making  use  of  two  evident rules.  Those  constituents  which  belong  to  the  row  and column  of  a  given  constituent  a,  will  be  designated  *'  a's  con- stituents." Also,  two  pairs  of  constituents  such  as  a^,  c,  and dg,  c^,  forming  the  corners  of  a  rectangle,  will  be  said  to  be *'  conjugate"  to  each  other.
Rule  I. — No  constituent  loill  he  found  in  the  same  term with  one  of  its  oion  constituents.
Rule  II. — The  conjugates  of  any  two  constituents  a  and  b will  he  cuinnion  to  a's  and  Us  constituents.
Ex. — To  write  the  following  terms  in  the  form  of  a  determinant : uhcd  +  Ifyl  +fh^  +  ledf+  cghp  + 1  ahr  +  elpr —fhpr—ahlr—ach^  —  Ifhg  —  bdf^  —  efhl  —  cedp.
The  determinant  will  be  of  the  fourth  order ;  and  since  every  term  must contain  four  constituents,  the  constituent  1  is  supplied  to  make  up  the number  in  some  of  the  terms.  Select  any  term,  as  ahcd,  for  the  leading diagonal.
Kow  apply  Rule  I., a  ia  not  found  with  e,f,f,  g,p,0...(l)-      c  is  not  found  with  /,/,  I,  r,  1,  0...  (^). 1)  is  not  found  with  e,  h,  h,p,l,0  ..(2).      dis  not  found  with  g,  h,h,l,r,0...(-i).
Each  constituent  has  2  (»— 1),  that  is,  6  constituents  belonging  to  it,  since n  =?'4.  Assuming,  therefore,  that  the  above  letters  are  the  constituents  of a,  b,  c,  and  d,  and  that  there  are  no  more,  we  supply  a  sixth  zero  constituent in  each  case.
Now  apply  Rule  II. — The  constituents  common
to  a  and  b  are  e,  p  ;     to  a  and  c — -/, /;  to  b  and  c — 1,  0  ;
to  a  and  d — g,  0  ;         to  h  and  d — h,  li,  0  ;     to  c  and  d-
The  determinant  may  now  be  formed.  Tlie  diagonal being  abed,;  place  e,  p,  the  eoiijugatus  of  a  and  b,  either  as in  the  diagram  or  transposed.
Then  /and/,  the  conjugates  of  a  and  c,  may  be  written.
1  and  0,  the  conjugates  of  b  and  c,  must  be  placed  as  indicated,  becau.so 1  is  one  of  y/s  constituents,  sini-e  it  is  nt)b  found  in  any  term  with  /i,  and must  therefore  be  in  the  second  row.
Similarly  tlie  places  of  y  and  0,  and  of  Z  and  r,  are  assigned.
In  the  c-ase  of  b  and  d  we  have  h,  h,  0  from  wliieh  to  clioose  the  two conjugates,  but,  we  see  that  0  is  not  one  of  them  because  that  would  assigu two  zero  constituents  to  b,  whereas  b  has  but  one,  which  is  already  placed.
By  similar  reasoning  the  ambiguity  in  selecting  the  conjugates  I,  r  is removed.

573  Let  the  following  system  of  n  equations  in  XicV,.^  ...  x^ be  transformed  by  substituting  the  accompanying  values  of the  variables,
The  ehminant  of  the  resulting  equations  in  ^^  ^.,  •  •  •  ^»  is the  determinant  S  in  (570),  and  is  therefore  equal  to  the product  of  the  determinants  P  and  Q.  The  determinant  Q  is then  termed  the  modulus  of  transformation.

Proof. — Substitute  the  values  of  4i,  l^ ...  4„  in  terras  of  x^,  x^ ...  a;„  in equation  (1),  and  equate  coefficients  of  the  squares  and  products  of  the  new variables.     We  get  the  n^  equations
a\^-V     +  =  1 fliCj  +  h^h^  +  =  0

Form  the  square  of  the  determinant  A  by  the rule  (570),  and  these  equations  show  that  the product  is  a  determinant  in  which  the  only  con- stituents that  do  not  vanish  constitute  a  diagonal of  '  ones.'     Therefore
A'^  =  1   and   A  =  ±l.
Again,  solving  the  first  set  of  equations for  ai  (writing  a,  as  a-^^a^,  &c.),  the  second set  for  ao,  the  third  for  a.^,  and  so  on,  we have,  by  (582),  the  results  annexed  ;  which, proves  the  second  proposition.

585  Theorem. — The  7i  — 2*''  power  of  a  determinant  of  the n^^  order  multiphed  by  any  constituent  is  equal  to  the  corre- sponding minor  of  the  reciprocal  determinant.
Proof. — Let  p  be  the  reciprocal  determinant  of  A,  and  /3,.  the  minor  of  i?^ in  p.  "Write  the  transformed  equations  (582)  for  the  xs  in  terms  of  the  1% and  solve  them  for  l^.  Then  equate  the  coefficient  of  x^  in  the  result  with  its coefficient  in  the  original  value  of  .^0.

1.  Bezant's  Method. — Suppose  m  >  n.
Rule. — Bring  the  (ujuatiom  to  the  same  degree  by  multi- plying (2)  by  «"•-".  Then  multiply  (1)  by  a\  and  (2)  by  a,  and subtract.
Again,  multiply  (1)  by  a\r-\-b\  and  (2)  by  {'i,r-\-b),  and subtract.
Again,  multiply  (1)  by  ax--\-b'x-\-c\  and  (2)  by  {a£'-\-bx-\-c), and  subtract,  and  so  on  until  n  equations  have  been  obtained. Each  null  be  of  the  degree  m—l.
Write  under  these  the  m—n  equations  obtained  by  multi- plying (2)  successively  by  x.  The  eliminant  of  the  m  equations is  the  result  required.
Ex.— Let  the  equations  be       (  a  a;'  +  h  ai'  +  c  re"  +  d  x'  +  ex  +f  =  0,

Should  the  cqaations  be  of  the  same  degree,  the  eliminant  will   be  a  sym- metrical determinant.

588  III    Method  of  elimination  by  Symmetrical  Functions.
Divide  the  two  equations  in  (586)  respectively  by  the coefficients  of  their  first   terms,  thus  reducing  them  to  the
forms  /Gr)  =.r-  +  /)i^^-^+  ...  -\-p^=  0,
<l>  (cv)  =  .v''  +  </i  cr'*"^  +  . . .  +  7n  =  0.
Rule. — Let  a,  b,  c  ...  represent  the  roots  of  f{x).  Form the  equation  <p{a)  (p  (b)  <{>  (c)  . . .  =  0.  This  will  contain  sym- metrical functions  only  of  the  roots  a,b,c....
Express  these  functions  in  terms  of  pi,  p2  "-by  (538),  ^'c, and  the  equation  becomes  the  eliminant.
Reason  of  the  rule. — The  eliminant  is  the  condition  for  a  common  root  of the  two  equations.  That  root  must  make  one  of  the  factors  0  (a),  ^  (6)  ... vanish,  and  therefore  it  makes  their  product  vanish.
589  The  ehminant  expressed  in  terms  of  the  roots  a,  b,c  ... of /(,7'),  and  the  roots  o,  )3,  y  ...  of  ^  {x),  will  be
(,,_«)  (a-^)  (a-y)  ...  (/.-«)  (6-/3)  {h-y)  ...  &c.,
being  the  product  of  all  possible  differences  between  a  root  of one  equation  and  a  root  of  another.
590  The  eliminant  is  a  homogeneous  function  of  the  co- efficients of  either  equation,  being  of  the  n^^  degree  in  the coefficients  of  f{x),  and  of  the  m^^^  degree  in  the  coefficients of  .^  (a').
591  The  sum  of  the  suffixes  of  p  and  q  in  each  term  of  the eliminant  =  ran.  Also,  if  p,  q  contain  z ;  if  p.y,  q.,  contain  z' ; if  2?s,  qs  contain  :^,  and  so  on,  the  eliminant  will  contain  z"'".
Proved  by  the  fact  that  p^  is  a  homogeneous  function  of  r  dimensions  of the  roots  a,  b,  c  ...,  hy  (40G).
592  If  the  two  equations  involve  x  and  y,  the  elimination may  be  conducted  with  respect  to  x ;  and  y  will  be  contained in  the  coefficients  p^,  j^z  •••i  ^Iv  Q2  •••  -

The  poles  of  a  great  circle  are  the  extremities  of  the diameter  perpendicular  to  its  plane.
The  sides  a,  6,  c  of  a  spherical  triangle  are  the  arcs  of great  circles  BG,  CA,  AB  on  a  sphere  of  radius  unity;  and the  angles  .1,  B,  C  are  the  angles  between  the  tangents  to  the sides  at  the  vertices,  or  the  angles  between  the  planes  of  the great  circles.     The  centre  of  the  sphere  will  be  denoted  by  0.
The  ])olar  triangle  of  a  spherical  triangle  ABC  has  for  its angvdar  points  A\  B\  C\  the  poles  of  the  sides  /?C,  CA,  AB of  the  primitive  triangle  in  the  directions  of  A,  B,  C  respec- tively (since  each  great  circle  has  two  i)oles).  The  sides  of A'B'C  are  denoted  by  a\  h\  c.
871  The  sides  and  angles  of  the polai-  triangle  are  respectively  the supplements  of  the  angles  and sides  of  the  primitive  triangle  ; that  is,
n'-\-A  =  //+/;  =  r'-\-('  ^  n,

The  polar  diai.'r;im  of  a  spherical  i»nIytron  is  formed  in  the  same  way,  and
tlie  same  relations  subsist  between  the  sides  and  au'^les  of  the  two  Hy^ure.*'.

Rule. — Hence,  any  equation  between  the  slides  and  angles of  a  spherical  triangle  jyroduces  a  siqjplementary  equation  by changing  a  into  tt  — A  and  A  into  tt— a,  ^c.
872  The  centre  of  the  inscribed  circle,  radius  r,  is  also  the centre  of  the  circumscribed  circle,  radius  R\  of  the  polar triangle,  and  v-^ll'  =  ^tt.
Pkoof. — In  the  last  figure,  let  0  be  the  centre  of  the  inscribed  circle  of ABC;  tlun  01),  the  perpendicular  on  BC,  passes  through  A\  the  pole  of  BG. Also,  OD  =  r;  therefore  OA'=h'r—r.  Similarly  0B'=  0G'=Itt—7-;  there- fore 0  is  the  centre  of  the  circumscribed  circle  of  A'B'C,  and  r-\-B'=  ^tt.
873  The  sine  of  the  arc  joining  a  point  on  the  circumference of  a  small  circle  with  the  pole  of  a  parallel  great  circle,  is  equal to  the  ratio  of  the  circumferences  or  corresponding  arcs  of  the two  circles.
For  it  is  equal  to  the  radius  of  the  small  circle  divided  by  the  radius  of the  sphere ;  that  is,  by  the  radius  of  the  great  circle.

I.  sineofun'diUrjiarf  =  jn-odiirt  of  faiKjfiifs  ifaJjdcciif  jvtrfs.
II.  sine  of  middle  part  =  product  of  cosines  of  opposite  parts.
In  applying  the  rules  we  can  take  J,  B,  c  instead  of  their
complements,  and  change  sine  into  cos,  or  vice  vers/i,  for  those
parts  at  once.     Thus,  taking  b  for  the  middle  part,
sin  b  =  tan  a  cot  .7  =  sin B  sine.

Proof. — From  any  point  P  in  OA,  draw PR  perpendicular  to  OC,  and  EQ  to  OB; therefore  I'liQ  is  a  right  aiigle  ;  tlierefore  OB is  perpendicular  to  PR  and  Q1i\  and  therefore to  PQ.

Draw  SYB  at  right  angles  to  QY, making  r7i'  =  TS.  Join  BS\  cntting QY  in  P.  Then  P  will  be  the  required point.
Proof. — For,  if  D  be  any  other  point on  the  line,  SD  =  Dli  and  SP  =  PR. But  BD  +  US'  is  >  BS';  therefore,  (to. B  is  called  the  reflection  of  the  point  i9, and  SP.S"  is  the  path  of  a  ray  of  light reflected  at  the  line  QY.
If  ^,  S'  and  QY  are  not  in  the  same  plane,  make  SY,  YB  equal  perpen- diculars as  before,  but  the  last  in  the  plane  of  S'  and  QY.
Similarly,  the  point  Q  in  the  given  line,  the  diSerence  of  whose  distances from  the  fixed  points  8  and  B'  is  a  maximum,  is  found  by  a  like  construction.
The  minimum  sum  of  distances  from  8,  S'  is  given  by (^7^  +  ^-7^)-=  SS"'+4^SY.S'Y'. And  the  maximum  difference  from  S  and  R'  is  given  by {SQ-R'QY=  {SHy-4^SY.IVY'.

937  Given  in  position  any  three  of  the  following  nine  data — viz.,  three  points,  three  straight  lines,  and  three  circles, — it  is required  to  describe  a  circle  passing  through  the  given  points and  touching  the  given  lines  or  circles.  The  following  five principal  cases  occur.
938  I.  Given  two  points  A^  J9,  and  the  straight  line  CD.
Analysis. — Let  ABX  be  the  required circle,  touching  GD  in  X.     Therefore
GX'=^GA.GB.       (III.  36)
Hence  the  point  X  can  be  found,  and  the centre  of  the  circle  defined  by  the  inter- section of  the  perpendicular  to  (yD  through X  and  the  perpendicular  bisector  of  AB. There  are  two  solutions.
Otherwise,  by  (926),  making  the  ratio one  of  equality,  and  DO  the  given  line.
Cor. — The  point  X  thus  determined  is  the  point  in  GD  at which  the  distance  AB  subtends  the  greatest  angle.  In  the solution  of  (941)  Q  is  a  similar  point  in  the  circumference  GD.

In  the  last  figure  draw  AOG  perpendicular  to  DO,  the  bisector  of  the angle  D,  and  make  OB  =  OA,  and  this  case  is  solved  by  Case  I.
940  III-  Given  the  point  P,  the  straight  line  DE,  and  the circle  AGF.
Analysis.  —  Let  PEF  be  the  required circle  touching  the  given  line  in  E  and  the circle  in  F.
Through  IF,  the  centre  of  the  given circle,  draw  AHGD  perpendicular  to  DE. Let  K  be  the  centre  of  the  other  circle. Join  11 K,  passing  through  Z'',  the  point  of contact.  Join  AF,  EF,  and  AF,  cutting the  required  circle  in  X.     Then
^DHF  =  LKF;  (1.27)
therefore  UFA  =  KFE  (the  halves  of  equal angles) ;  therefore  AF,  FE  are  in  the  same straight  line.     Then,  because  AX.AP  =  AF.AE,  (III.  36)
and  AF.AF  :c=  AG  .AD  by  similar  triangles,   therefore  ^X  can  bo  found. A  circle  must  then  be  described  through  P  and  X  to  touch  the  given  line,

by  Caso  I.  There  are  two  solutions  with  exterior  contact,  as  appears  from Case  1.  These  are  indicated  in  the  diagram.  There  are  two  more  in  wliich the  circle  J C  lies  witliin  the  described  circle.  The  construction  is  quite analogous,  C  taking  the  place  of  A.
941  IV.  Given  two  points  Ay  B  and the  circle  CD.
Draw  any  circle  through  A,  B,  cutting  tho required  circle  in  C,  D.  Draw  AB  and  DC, anil  lot  them  meet  in  F.  Draw  FQ  to  touch the  given  circle.     Then,  because
FC.FD  =  FA  . FB  =  FQ\    (TIL  30)
and  the  required  circle  is  to  pass  through A,  B  ;  therefore  a  circle  drawn  through  A,  B,  (^ must  touch  FQ.  and  therefore  the  circle  CJ), in  Q  (III.  37),  and  it  can  be  described  by  Caso I.  There  are  two  solutions  corresponding  to the  two  tangents  from  F  to  the  circle  CD.
942     V.  Given  one  point  P,  and  two  circles,  centres  A  and  B.
Analysis. — Let  FFO  be  tho  required  circle  touching  the  given  ones  in  F and  0.  Join  the  centres  QA,  QB.  Join  FG,  and  produce  it  to  cut  tho circles  in  E  and  //,  and  the  lino  of  centres  in  0.  Then,  by  the  isosceles triangles,  the  four  angles  at  F,  F,  G,  II  are  all  equal  ;  therefore  AE,  BG  are parallel,  and  so  arc  .1/'',  BII\  therefore  AO  :  BO  ::  AF  :  Hit,  and  0  is  a centre  of  similitude  for  tho  two  circles.  Again,  Z  IIJiK  =  211  IjK,  and FAM  =  2FNM  (HI.  20)  ;  therefore  FNM  =  IILK=  IIGK  (III.  21)  ;  there- fore  the  triangles  OFN,  OKG  are  similar;  therefore  OF .  OG  =  OK .  OM ; therefore,  if  OF  cut  the  required  circle  in  X,  OX .  OF  =  OK.  ON.  Thus the  point  A'  can  be  found,  and  tho  problem  is  reduced  to  Case  IV.
Two  circles  can  be  drawn  througli  F  and  X  to  touch  tho  given  circles. One  is  the  circle  FFX.  The  centre  of  the  other  is  at  tlie  ]K)int  where  EA and  JIB  meet  if  produced,  and  this  circle  touches  the  given  ones  in  F  and  //.
943  An  analogous  construction,  employing  the  internal  centre  of  simili- tude 0',  determines  the  circle  which  passes  through  F,  and  touches  one  given circle  externally  and  the  other  internally.     See  (1017-1)).
The  centres  of  similitude  are  tho  two  points  which  divide  tho  di.stanco between  the  centres  in  the  ratio  of  the  radii.     See  (1037).

The  Nine-Point  Circle.
954  The  Nine-point  circle  is  the  circle  described  through I),  E,  F,  the  feet  of  the  perpendiculars  on  the  sides  of  the triangle  ABG.  It  also  passes  through  the  middle  points  of the  sides  of  ABG  and  the  middle  points  of  OA,  OB,  OG ;  in all,  through  nine  points.
Proof. — Let  the  circle cut  the  sides  of  ABG again  in  G,  H,  K;  and OA,  OB,  OG  in  L,  M,  N. /.EMF=EDF  (III.  21) =  20DF  (952,  Cor.); therefore,  since  OB  is  the diameter  of  the  circle  cir- cumscribing OFBD  (III. 31),  ill  is  the  centre  of that  circle  (III.  20),  and therefore  bisects  OB.
Similarly  OG  and  OA are  bisected  at  N  and  L.
Again,  Z  MGB  =  MED  (III.  22)  =  OGD,  (HI.  21),  by  the  circle  circum- scribing  OEGD.  Therefore  MG  is  parallel  to  OG,  and  therefore  bisects  BG. Similarly  H  and  K  bisect  GA  and  AB.
955  The  centre  of  the nine-point  circle  is  the middle  point  of  OQ,  the line  joining  the  ortho- centre  and  the  centre of  the  circumscribing circle  of  the  triangle ABG.
For  the  centre  of  the  N.  P. circle  is  the  intersection  of the  perpendicular  bisectors of  the  chords  DG,  EH,  FK, and  these  perpendiculars bisect  OQ  in  the  same  point N,  by  (VI.  2).
956  The   centroid  of the  triangle  jUiG  also  lies  on  the  line  OQ  and  divides  it  in B  so  that  OB  =  2BQ.
Pkook.— The  triangles  QUG,  OAB  are  similar,  and  AB  =:  2nG ;  there- fore  A  0  =  2GQ  ;  tluM-eforo  Oli  =  2h'(2  ;  and  Ali  =  2ii'c; ;  therefore  B  is  the centroid,  and  it  divides  0(2  as  stated  (051).

957  Hence  the  line  joining  the  centres  of  the  circumscribed and  nine-point  circles  is  divided  harmonically  in  the  I'atio  of 2  :  1   by  the  centroid  and  the  orthocentre  of  the  ti-ian<^le.
These  two  points  are  therefore  centres  of  similitude  of  the circiimscri])ed  and  nine-point  circles ;  and  any  line  drawn through  either  of  the  points  is  divided  by  the  circumferencca in  the^-atio  of  2  :  1.     See  (1037.)

For,  if  EF  meets  BC  in  F,  tlieu  by  the  circle  circumscribing  FCEF, FE  .  FF  =  FC  .  FB  ;  therefore  (III.  3G)  the  tangents  from  F  to  the  circles are  equal  (985).   
959  The  nine-point  circle  touches  the  inscribed  and  escribed circles  of  the  triangle.
Proof. — Let  0  be  the  orthocentre,  and  7,  Q the  centres  of  the  inscribed  and  circumscribed circles.  Produce  AI  to  bisect  the  arc  1>G  in  T. Bisect  AG  in  L,  and  join  GL,  cutting  AT  in  .S'.
The  N.  P.  circle  passes  through  G,  V,  and L  (9o-i),  and  !»  is  a  right  angle.  Therefore GL  is  a  diameter,  and  is  therefore  =  R=  QA (957).  Therefore  GL  and  QA  are  parallel. But   QA  =  QT,  therefore

N  being  the  centre  of  the  N.  P.  circle,  its radius  =  NG  =  ^R;  and  r  being  the  radius  of the  inscribed  circle,  it  is  required  to  shew  that NI  =  NG-r. Now  NP  =  SN'-{-SP-2SN.  SI  cos  0.  (702)

If  J  be  the  centre  of  the  escribed  circle  touching  BC,  and  r„  its  radius,  it is  shewn  in  a  similar  way  that  NJ  =  NG  +  r^.

Analysis. — Let  ABG  be  the  required  triangle.  Oa A'B  make  the  triangle  A'BG'  similar  to  ABG,  so  that AB  :  A'B  ::  GB  :  G'B.  The  angles  ABA',  GBG'  will also  be  equal;  therefore  AB  :  BG  ::  AA'  :  GC,  which gives  GG',  since  the  ratio  AB  :  BG  is  known.  Hence the    point  G  is   found   by   constructing    the    triangle

Therefore  the  triangles  DPP,  BGP  are  simihir;  therefore  DF  is  a  mean  pro- portional to  DB  and  DC.     Hence  the  construction.

Find  the locus  of  P  by  the  last  proposition,  so  that the  tangent  from  P  to  this  circle  may  have the  given  ratio  to  FB.  It  will  be  the  re- quired locus.

967  Definitions. — Points  lying  in  the  same  straight  line  are colUnear.  Straight  lines  passing  through  the  same  point  are concurrent^  and  the  point  is  called  the  focus  of  the  pencil  of lines.
Theorem. — If  the  sides  of  the  triangle  ABG,  or  the  sides produced,  be  cut  bj  any  straight  line  in  the  points  a,  6,  o respectively,  the  line  is  called  a  transversal,  and  the  segments of  the  sides  are  connected  by  the  equation
968  {Ah  :  hC)  {Ca  :  aB)  (Be  :  cA)  =  1.
Conversely,  if  this  relation  holds,  the  points  a,  h,  c  will  be collinear.
Proof.  —  Througli  any  vertex  A  draw  AD parallel  to  the  opposite  side  BG,  to  meet  the transversal  in  D,  then
Ab  :  bG  =  AD  :  Ca   and   Be,  :  cA  =  aB  :  AD (VI.  4),  which  proves  the  theorem.
Note. — In  the  formula  the  segments  of  the sides    are    estimated    positive,    independently   of direction,  the  sequence  of  the  letters  being  pre- served the  better  to  assist  the  memory.     A  point  may  be  supposed  to  travel from  A  over  the  segments  Ab,  bC,  &c.  continuously,  until  it  reaches  A  again.
969  By  the  aid  of  (701)  the  above  relation  may  be  put  in the  form
(sin  ABb  :  sin  bBC)  (sin C^a  :  sin  aAB)  (sin  BCc  :  sin  cCA)  =  l

Conversely,  if  this  relation  holds,  the  lines  Aa,  Bh,  Cc  will be  concurrent.

971  Tf  J>r,  ca,  ah,  in  tlic  last  figure,  be  produced  to  meet  the sides  of  .l//Oin  1\  Q,  R,  then  eac^h  of  the  nine  lines  in  the tiu-nro  will  be  divided  liannoiiically,  and  tlie  points  J\  (,',  R ^vill  be  collinear.
Proof. — (i.)  Take  hP  a  transversal  to  ABC;  therefore,  by  (^08), {Cr  :  PB)  (Be  :  cyl)  (Ab  :  hC)  =  1 ; tlu-rcforo,  by  (1170),  CP  :  PB  =  Ca  :  uB.
(ii.)   Take  CP  a  transversal  to  Abe,  therefore
(AB  :  Be)  (cP  :  Pb)  (bC  :  CA)  =  1. But,  by  (070),  taking  0  for  focus  to  Abe,
(AB  :  Be)  (ep  :  pb)  (bC  :  CA)  =  1 ; therefore  cP  :  Pb  =  ep  :  pb.
(iii.)  Take  PC  a  transversal  to  AOe,  and  b  a  focus  to  AOc\  therefore,  by (0G8  &  070),  (.la  :  aO)  (OG  :  Cc)  (cB  :  BA)  =  1,
and  (Ap  :  pO)  (OC  :  Cc)  (eB  :  I?-l)  =  1 ;
therefore  Aa  :  aO  =  ylj)  :  i'O.
Thus  all  tlio  lines  are  divided  harmonically.
(iv.)  In  the  equation  of  (070)  put  Ab  :  bC  =  AQ  :  QC  the  harmonic ratio,  and  similarly  for  each  ratio,  and  the  result  proves  that  P,  Q,  R  aro collinear,  by  (008).
Cor. — If  in  the  same  figure  qr,  rj),  pq  be  joined,  the  three lines  will  pass  through  P,  (^,  li  respectively.
Proof. — Take  0  as  a  focus  to  the  triangle  abc,  and  employ  (070)  and  the harmonic  division  of  be  to  show  that  the  transversal  rq  cuts  be  in  P.
972  If  a  transversal  intersects  the  sides  AB,  lUl,  CD,  &c. of  any  polygon  in  the  points  a,  h,  c,  &c.  in  order,  tlien

973  Let  any  transversal  cut  the  sides  of  a  triangle  and tlieir  three  intersectors  AO,  HO,  CO  (see  figure  of  V70)  in  tbe points  A',  B',  C,  a,  h' ,  c  ,  respectively;  then,  as  before,

974  If  the  lines  joining  corresponding  vertices  of  two  tri- angles ABC,  abc  are  concurrent,  the  points  of  intersection of  the  pairs  of  corresponding sides  are  collinear,  and  con- versely.
Proof. —  Let  tho  concurront  lines Aa,  Bh,  Cc  meet  in  0.  Take  be, ca,  ah  transversals  respectively  to the  triangles  OBG,  OCA,  OAB,  ap- plying (9G8),  and  tlio  product  of  the three  equations  shows  that  P,  E,  Q lie  on  a  transversal  to  ABC.  p
975  Hence  it  follows  that,  if  the  lines  joining  each  pair  of corresponding  vertices  of  any  two  rectilineal  figures  are  con- current, the  pairs  of  corresponding  sides  intersect  in  points which  are  collinear.
The  figures  in  this  case  are  said  to  be  in  pprspectlce^  or  in, homology,  with  each  other.  The  point  of  concuiTcnce  and the  hne  of  collinearity  are  called  respectively  the  centre  and axis  of  perspective  or  homology.     See  (1083).
976  Theorem. — When  three  perpendiculars  to  the  sides  of  a triangle  ABC,  intersecting  them  in  the  points  a,  b,  c  respec- tively, are  concurrent,  the  following  relation  is  satisfied ;  and converse^,  if  the  relation  be  satisfied,  the  perpendiculars  are concurrent.
Afr-bC'+C(r-aB--\-Bc'-cA''  =  0.
Proof. — If  the  perpendiculars  meet  in  0,  then  Ab''  —  bC-=  AO'-—OC-, &c.  (I.  47).
Examples. — By  the  application  of  this  theorem,  the  concurrence  of  the three  perpendiculars  is  readily  established  in  the  following  cases: —
(1)  When  the  perpendiculars  bisect  the  sides  of  the  triangle
(2)  When  they  pass  through  the  vertices.      (By  employing  I.  47.)
(3)  The  three  i-adiioflhe  esci-ibed  circles  of  a  triangle  at  the  points  of contact  between  the  vertices  are  concui-rent.  So  also  arc;  the  radius  of  the inscribed  circle  at  the  point  of  contact  wilh  one  side,  and  the  radii  of  tho  two escribed  circles  of  the  remaining  sides  at  tho  points  of  contact  beyond  the included  angle.
In  these  cases  employ  the  values  of  the  segments  criven  in  (953).
(4)  The  pei'j>endiculars  equidistant  from  the  vertices  with  three  con- current perpendiculars  are  also  concun-cnt.
(5)  When  the  three  perpendiculars  from  the  vertices  of  one  triangle  upon the  sides  of  the  other  are  concurrent,  then  tho  perpendiculars  from  the vertices  of  the  second  triangle  upon  the  sides  of  the  tirst  are  also  concurrent.
Proof. — If  A,  B,  G  and  A\  If,  C  are  corresponding  vertices  of  the  tri- angles, join  AB\  AC\  BC,  BA\  CA,  CR,  and  apply  the  theorem  in  conjuuc- tiou  witlj  (I.  47).

Construct  the  fitjure  ABCO  independently  fi-om  the  known  sides  of  ABG and  the  angles  at  0,  which  are  equal  to  the  sui)i)lenients  of  the  given  angles a,  b,  c.  Thus  the  angles  OAG,  &c  are  found,  and  therefore  the  angles  ObC, &c.,  equal  to  them  (III.  21),  are  known.  From  these  last  angles  the  point  0 can  be  determined,  and  the  lengths  OA,  OB,  00  being  known  from  the  inde- pendent figure,  the  points  A,  B,  C  can  be  found.
Observe  that,  wherever  the  point  0  may  be  taken,  the  angles  AOB,  BOO COA  are  in  all  cases  either  the  supplements  of,  or  equal  to,  the  angles  c,  a,  b respectively;  while  the  angles  aOb,  bOc,  cOa  are  in  all  cases  equal  to  C  zh  c, A±a,  B±b.
983  Note. — In  general  problems,  like  the  foregoing,  wliicli admit  of  different  cases,  it  is  advisable  to  clioose  for  reference a  standard  figure  which  has  all  its  elements  of  the  same  affec- tion or  sign.  In  adapting  the  figure  to  other  cases,  all  that is  necessary  is  to  follow  the  same  construction,  letter  for letter,  observing  the  convention  respecting  positive  and negative,  which  applies  both  to  the  lengths  of  lines  and  to the  magnitudes  of  angles,  as  explained  in  (607 — 609).

Proof. — In  the  same  figure,  if  P  be  tlie  centre  of  the  variable  circle,  and if  PX=PY  be  its  radius;  then,  by  (088),
FX  (XX'-  YY')  =  2An .  TN. But  XX'  =  2a  cos  (I     and     YY'  =  2h  cos  ft  ;
therefore  PX  :  PX  =  a  cos  a  — &  cos  ft  :  AB,
which  is  a  constant  ratio  if  the  angles  (i,  ft  are  constant.
990  Also  FX  :  PN  =  the  cosine  of  the  angle  at  which  the circle  of  radius  PX  cuts  the  radical  axis.  This  angle  is therefore  constant.
991  Cor, — A  circle  which  touches  two  fixed  circles  has  its radius  in  a  constant  ratio  to  the  distance  of  its  centre  from their  radical  axis.
This  follows  from  the  proposition  by  making   a  =  ft  =  0  or  Ott.
If  P  be  on  the  radical  axis ;  then  (see  Figs.  1  and  2  of  984)
992  (i.)  The  tangents  from  P  to  the  two  circles  are  equal, or  FK  =  FT.  (986)
993  (ii-)  The  rectangles  under  the  segments  of  chords through  P  are  equal,  or  FX  .  FX' =  FY .  FY'.  (988)
994  (iii-)  Therefore  the  four  points  X,  X',  T,  Y'  are  con- cychc  (III.  36);  and,  conversely,  if  they  are  concychc,  the chords  XX' J  YY'  intersect  in  the  radical  axis.
995  Definition. — Points  which  lie  on  the  circumference  of a  circle  are  termed  coney  die.
996  (iv.)  If  P  be  the  centre,  and  if  PX  =  PY  be  the  radius of  a  circle  intersecting  the  two  circles  in  the  figure  at  angles a  and  /3;  then,  by  (993),  XX'=YY',  or  a  cos  a  =  Z>  cos  pJ ; that  is,  The  cosines  of  the  angles  of  intersection  are  inversclj/ as  the  radii  of  the  fixed  circles.
997  The  radical  axes  of  three  circles  (Fig.  1046),  taken  two and  two  together,  intersect  at  a  point  called  their  radical  centre.

1007  Def. — The  line  IQ,  is  called  the  axis  of  reflexion  for the  two  inverse  points  D,  D',  because  there  is  another  circle of  inversion,  the  reflexion  of  the  former,  to  the  right  of  1(^, having  also  D,  I)'  for  inverse  points.

Also,  because  Z  OR  A  =  OR  A,  the  four  points  0.  A,  B,  P  lie  on  a  circle  in each  case  (III.  21),  and  therefore  (^.4  .  QR  =  QO  .  QR  (III.  35,  3G).
1009  The  inverse  of  a  circle  is  a  circle,  and  the  centre  of inversion  is  the  centre  of  simihtude  of  the  two  figures.  See also  (1087).

Rule. — Take  the  centre  of  inversion  so  that  the  squares  of the  taiKjeiits  from  it  to  the  given  circles  may  he  irroportioual  to their  radii  (965).
PKOOK.-(Fig.  1013)  AT  :  7?7i'  =  OT  :  07?,  =  07"  :  P,  since  OT  :  /.:  :  OR. Therefore  OT^  :  AT  =  Jc^  :  lili,  therefore  L' A'  remains  constant  if  OT^  <x  AT.
1011  lleiiec  three  circles  may  be  inverted  into  equal  circles, for  the  reciuired  centre  of  inversion  is  the  intersection  of  two circles  that  can  be  drawn  by  (965).
1012  The   inverse  of  a  straight   line   is  a  circle   passing through  the  centre  of  inversion.
Proof. — Draw  OQ  perpendicular  to  the line,  and  take  P  any  otlicr  point  on  it.  Let Q\  F  be  the  inverse  points.  Then  OP  .  0F= OQ-OQ';  therefore,  by  similar  triangles, Z  OFQ'  =  OQr,  a  right  angle  ;  and  OQ  is constant,  therefore  the  locus  of  F  is  tho circle  whose  diameter  is  OC^.

Pole  and  Polar.
1016  Defixitiox. — The  iMar  of  any  point  P  with  respect to  a  circle  is  the  perpendicular  to  the  diameter  OF  (Fig.  1012) drawn  through  the  inverse  point  F .
1017  It  follows  that  the  polar  of  a  point  exterior  to  the circle  is  the  cliord  of  contact  of  the  tangents  fron  the  point; that  is,  the  hne  joining  their  points  of  contact.
1018  Also,  FQ  is  the  polar  of  F  with  respect  to  the  circle, centre  0,  and  FQ  is  the  polar  of  Q.  In  other  words,  0iy point  P  hfhig  on  the  polar  of  a  point  Q',  has  its  oivn  polar alivays  passing  through  Q'.
1019  The  line  joining  any  two  points  P,  p  is  the  polar  of Q',  the  point  of  intersection  of  their  polars.
Proof. — The  point  Q'  lies  on  both  the  lines  P'Q',  i^'Q'y  and  therefore  has its  polar  passing  through  the  pole  of  each  line,  by  the  last  theorem.
1020  The  polars  of  any  two  points  F,p,  and  the  line  joining the  points  form  a  self-reciprocal  triangle  witli  respect  to the  circle,  the  three  vertices  being  the  poles  of  the  opposite sides.  The  centre  0  of  the  circle  is  evidently  the  orthocentre of  the  triangle  (952).  The  circle  and  its  centre  are  called  the polar  circle  and  j^olar  centre  of  the  triangle.
If  the  radii  of  the  polar  and  circumscribed  circles  of  a triangle  ABC  be  r  and  P,  then
r^  =  4iIV  cos  A  cos  B  cos  C
Proof. — In  Fig.  (052),  0  is  the  centre  of  the  polar  circle,  and  the  circles described  round  AB(\BOC,  COA,  A0J3  are  all  equal;  because  the  angle BOO  is  the  supplement  of  vl ;  &c.

When  0  is  atZ)  or  //,  tlie  circle  whose radius  is  OK  vanishes.  "When  0  is  at  an  infinite  distance, the  circle  developes  into  the  radical  axis  itself  and  into  a  line at  infinity.
The  points  D,  D'  are  called  tlie  J imiting  points.

Tliese  circles  vary  between  the  circle  with centre  I  and  radius  S,  and  the  circle  with  its  centre  at  infinity as  described  above.  The  points  7?,  R'  are  the  common  points of  all  circles  of  this  system.  The  two  systems  are  therefore distinguished  as  the  timiting  jwints  sjjccies  and  the  common 2>oints  sjxjcics  of  coaxal  cii'cles.
220  ELEMENTARY  GEOMETRY.
1025  There  is  a  conjugate  system  of  circles  having  R,  B!  for limiting  points,  and  D,  1)'  for  common  points,  and  the  circles of  one  species  intersect  all  the  circles  of  the  conjugate  system of  the  other  species  orthogonally  (1005).
Thus,  in  figures  (1)  and  (2),  Q  is  the  centre  of  a  circle of  the  opposite  species  intersecting  the  other  circles  or- thogonally.
1026  In  the  first  species  of  coaxal  circles,  the  limiting points  D,  D'  are  inverse  points  for  every  circle  of  the  system, the  radical  axis  being  the  axis  of  reflexion  for  the  system.
Proof.— (Fig.  1)  OP-P  =  0K\
therefore  01)  .  OB'  =  OIP,  (II.  13)
therefore  D,  D'  are  inverse  points  (1000).
1027  Also,  the  points  in  which  any  circle  of  the  system cuts  the  central  axis  are  inverse  points  for  the  circle  whose centre  is  I  and  radius  S.  [Proof.— Similar  to  the  last.
1028  Problem. — Given  two  circles  of  a  coaxal  system,  to describe  a  circle  of  the  same  system — (i.)  to  pass  through  a given  point;  or  (ii.)  to  touch  a  given  circle ;  or  (iii.)  to  cut  a given  circle  orthogonally.
1029  I.  If  the  system  be  of  the  common  points  species,  then,  since  the required  circle  always  passes  through  two  known  points,  the  first  and  second cases  fall  under  the  Tangencies.      See  (91-1).
1030  To  solve  the  third  case,  describe  a  circle  through  the  given  common points,  and  through  the  inverse  of  either  of  them  with  respect  to  the  given circle,  which  will  then  be  cut  orthogonally,  by  (1005).
1031  II.  If  the  system  be  of  the  limiting  points  species,  the  problem  is solved  in  each  case  by  the  aid  of  a  circle  of  the  conjugate  system.  Such  a circle  always  passes  through  the  known  limiting  points,  and  may  be  called  a conjugate  circle  of  the  limiting  points  system.     Thus,
1032  To  solve  case  (i.) — Draw  a  conjugate  circle  through  the  given  point, and  the  tangent  to  it  at  that  point  will  be  the  radius  of  the  required  circle.
1033  To  solve  case  (ii.) — Draw  a  conjugate  circle  through  the  inverse of  either  limiting  point  with  respect  to  the  given  circle,  which  will  thus  be cut  orthogonally,  and  the  tangent  to  the  cutting  circle  at  either  point  of intersection  will  be  the  radius  of  the  required  circle.
1034  To  solve  case  (iii.) — Draw  a  conjugate  circle  to  touch  the  given  one, and  the  common  tangent  of  the  two  will  be  the  radius  of  the  required  circle.
1035  Thus,  according  as  we  wish  to  make  a  circle  of  the  system  loncli,  or cut  <iii/in</(i)i(iUi/,  the  given  circle,  wo  must  draw  a  conjugate  cii'cle  to  ctd orlhiHjvnalli/,  ur  iuuch  it.

1036  If  three  circles  be  coaxal,  the  squares  of  the  tanp^cnts drawn  to  any  two  of  tlieni  from  a  point  on  tlie  tliii-d  are  in the  ratio  of  tlie  distances  of  the  centre  of  the  third  circle  from the  centres  of  the  other  two.

Centres  and  (Lies  of  similitude.
1037  Definitions.  —  Let  00'  be  the  centres  of  sirailitudo (Def .  1*  1-7)  of  the  two  circles  in  the  figure  below,  and  let  any line  tlirough  0  cut  the  circles  in  r,  Q,  P\  Q.  Then  the constant  ratio  OP  :  OP'  =  OQ  :  OQ'  is  called  the  ratio  of similitude  of  the  two  figures ;  and  the  constant  product OP  .OQ'  =  OQ  .  OF  is  called  the  i)roduct  of  anti-si  inilitade. See  (942),  (1009),  and  (1043).
The  corresponding  points  P,  V  or  Q,  Q'  on  the  samo straight  line  through  0  are  termed  liomoltxjoas,  and  P,  (/  or Q,  P  are  termed  anti-homologous.
1038  Lt^'t  any  other  line  Opqp'q  be  drawn  through  0. Tlien,  if  any  two  points  i',  p  on  the  one  figure  be  joined,  and if  P',  j/,  homologous  to  P,})  on  the  other  figure,  be  also  joined, the  lines  so  formed  are  termed  liomolotjous.  But  if  the  points Avhich  are  joined  on  the  second  figure  are  anti-liomologous  to those  on  the  first,  the  two  lines  are  termed  anti-homulojous. Thus,  Pq,  l/p'  are  anti-homologous  lines.
1039  Tlie  circle  Avhose  centre  is  0,  and  wliose  radius  is e(iual  to  the  square  root  of  the  product  of  anti-similitude,  is called  the  circle  of  anti-similitude.

that  is,  the  sines  of  the  halves  of  the  angles  in  question  are  equal,  which pioves  the  first  part.  Also,  because  the  tangents  from  K  are  iu  the  ctnstant ratio  of  the  radii  a,  h,  this  circle  is  coaxal  with  the  given  ones,  by  (lUoG,  1)34).
1046  The  six  centres  of  similitude  P,p,  Q,  q,  R,  r  of  three circles  lie  three  and  three  on  four  straight  lines  I'ijli,  I'qr, Qpr,  Rpq,  called  axes of  simUitude.

For  the  segments  of  its sides  made  by  the  points P,  'i,  r  are  in  the  ratios  of the  radii  of  the  circles.
224  ELEMENTARY  GEOMETRY.
1047  From  tlie  investigation  in  (0  12),  it  appears  that  one circle  touches  two  others  in  a  pair  of  anti-homologous  points, and  that  the  following  rule  obtains  : —
Rule. — The  right  line  joining  the  points  of  contact  imsses through  the  external  or  internal  centre  of  similitude  of  the  tivo circles  according  as  the  contacts  are  of  the  same  or  of  different kinds.
1048  Definition. — Contact  of  curves  is  either  internal  or  external  ac- cordiug  as  the  curvatures  at  the  point  of  contact  are  in  the  same  or  opposite directions.
1049  Gergo7ine''s  method  of  descrihing  the  circles  ichlch  touch three  given  circles.
Take  Pqr,  one  of  the  four  axes  of  similitude,  and  find  its  poles  o,  /3,  y with  respect  to  the  given  circles,  centres  A,  B,  G  (lOlG).  From  0,  the radical  centre,  draw  lines  through  a,  /3,  y,  cutting  the  circles  in  a,  a',  b,  b', c,  c.  Then  a,  b,  c  and  a',  b',  c  will  be  the  points  of  contact  of  two  of  the requii'ed  circles.
PjiOOP. — Analysis. — Let  the  circles E,  F  touch  the  circles  A,  B,  G  in a,  b,  c,  a',  b',  c.  Let  be,  b'c  meet  in P ;  ca,  c'a'  in  ci ;  and  ab,  a'b'  in  r.
Regarding  E  and  F  as  touched  by A,  B,  G  in  turn,  Rule  (1047)  shews that  Art',  bb',  cc'  meet  in  0,  the  centre of  similitude  of  jE/  and  F ;  and  (1041) shews  that  P,  q,  and  r  lie  on  the radical  axis  of  E  and  F.
Regarding  B  and  G,  or  G  and  A, or  A  and  B,  as  touched  hy  E  and  F in  turn,  Rule  (1047)  shews  that  P,  q,  r are  the  centres  of  similitude  of  ]>  and G,    G  and   A,  A   and  B  respectively;
and  (1041)  shews  that  0  is  on  the  radical  axis  of  each  pair,  and  is  therefore the  radical  centre  of  A,  B,  and  G.
Again,  becansc  the  tangents  to  E  and  F,  at  the  anti-homologous  points a,  a',  meet  on  Bqr,  the  radical  axis  of  E  and  F  (1042)  ;  therefore  the  point of  meeting  is  the  pole  of  <(«,'  with  respect  to  the  circle  .1  (1017).  Therefore aa'  ])as.ses  through  the  pole  of  the  line  Pifr  (1018).  Similarly,  bb'  and  cc' pass  through  the  poles  of  the  same  line  J'qr  with  respect  to  J>  and  G.  Hence the  construction.
1050  In  the  given  configuration  of  the  circles  A,  B,  C,  the (leinoiistration  shews  that  each  of  the  three  internal  axes  of similitude  P(/r,  (,>rp,  Jlju/  (Fig.  104())  is  a  radical  axis  and connnon  chord  of  tAvo  of  the  eight  osculating  circles  which can  be  drawn.     The  external  axis  of  similitude  Vi^li  is  the
AXirAIDlOXIC  JiATIO.
radical  axis  of  the  two  remaining  circles  which  touch  J,  7/, and  C  eitlier  all  externally  or  all  internally.
1051  Tlie  radical  centre  0  of  the  three  p^iven  circles  is  also tlie  common  internal  centre  of  similitude  of  the  four  paii-s  of osculating  circles.  Therefore  the  central  axis  of  each  pair passes  through  0,  and  is  peri)endicular  to  the  radical  axis. Thus,  in  the  figure,  EF  passes  thi-ough  0,  and  is  })erpen- dicular  to  Pqr.
Anharmonic  Ratio.
1052  Dkfixitiox. — Let  a  pencil  of four  lines  through  a  point  0  be  cut by  a  transversal  in  the  points  A,  B, (',  D.  The  anharmonic  ratio  of  the ])encil  is  any  one  of  the  three  frac- tions
A  B .  CD AD.BC
or
AB.rn
AC.BI)
AC.  liD
1053  The  relation  between  these  three  different  ratios  is obtained  from  the  equation
AB  .  CD-\^AD  .  BC  =  AC  .  BJ).
Denoting  the  terms  on  the  left  side  by  2'  and  </,  the  three  anharmonic i-atios  may  be  expressed  by
p  :  q,    p  :p  +  q,    q  :p  +  q.
The  ratios  are  therefore  mutually  dependent.  Hence,  if  the  identity merely  of  the  anharmonic  ratio  in  any  two  sj'stems  is  to  be  established,  it  is immaterial  which  of  the  three  ratios  is  selected.
1054  In  future,  when  the  ratio  of  an  anharmonic  pencil  {0,  AHl^'D]  is mentioned,  the  form  All.  CI)  :  AD.  I!C  will  be  the  on<?  intended,  wliatever the  actual  order  of  the  points  ,1,  7),  <\  D  may  be.  For,  it  should  be  observed that,  by  making  tlie  line  01>  revolve  about  0,  the  ratio  takes  in  turn  eacii  of the  forms  given  above.  This  ratio  is  shortly  expressed  by  the  notation {0,AI!('1J},  or  simply   {AUCD}.
1055  If  the  transversal  be  drawn  parallel  to  one  of  the  lines,  for  instance (>D,  the  two  factors  containing  7)  become  infinite,  and  their  ratio  becomes unity.  They  may  therefore  bo  omitted.  The  anharmonic  ratio  then  reduces to  AB  :  liC.     Thus,  when  IJ  is  at  infinity,  we  may  write
{0,  ^17)'rx}  =  .47?  :  BC.

and  its  value  is  therefore  tlie  same  for  all  transversals  of  the pencil.
Proof. — Draw  07?  parallel  to  the  transversal,  and  let  p  be  the  perpendi- cular from  A  upon  Oli.  Multiply  eacli  foctor  in  the  fraction  by  p.  Then substitute  i> .  AB  =  OA.OB  sin  AOB,  &c.  (707).
1057  The  anharmonic  ratio  (105(3)  becomes  harmonic  when  its  value  is unity.  See  (933).  The  harmonic  relation  there  defined  may  also  be  stated thus :  four  points  divide  a  line  harmonically  when  the  jjroclud  of  the  extreme segments  is  equal  to  the  proih(ct  < if  the  ivhole  line  and  the  middle  segment.

AVhen  two  inverse  points  coincide,  the  point  is  called  a

1067  The  equation  OP-  =  h^  shows  that  there  are  two  foci J ,  />'  at  the  distance  h  from  the  centre,  and  on  opposite  sides of  it,  real  or  imaginary  according  as  any  two  inverse  points lie  on  the  same  side  or  on  opposite  sides  of  the  centre.
1068  If  the  two  homogi^aphic  systems  of  points  in  (1058) be  on  the  same  line,  they  will  constitute  a  system  in  involu- tiun  when  B  =  C.

1069  Any  four  points  whaferrr  of  a  system  in  involution  on a  right  line  have  their  anharmouic  ratio  equal  to  that  of  their four  conjugates.

1074  The  relations  which  have  been  established  for  a  system  of  coUincar points  may  be  transferred  to  a  system  of  concurrent  lines  by  the  method  of (105G),  in  which  the  distance  between  two  points  corresponds  to  the  sine  of the  angle  between  two  lines  passing  through  those  points.

If  all  the  points  of  any  fio-ure,  ])lane  or  solid,  he  thus  ])ro- jected,  the  figure  obtained  is  called  the  ^injccfiou  of  the original  fia'ure.
1076  Projective Propertie.'i. — The  projection  of  a  right  line  is a  right  hne.  The  projections  of  parallel  lines  are  parallel.  The projections  of  a  curve,  and  of  the  tangent  at  any  point  of  it ,  aro another  curve  and  the  tangent  at  the  corresponding  point.
1077  The  anharmonic  ratio  of  the  segments  of  a  right  lino is  not  altered  by  projection  ;  for  the  line  and  its  projection  are but  two  transversals  of  the  same  anharmonic  pencil.      (105G)
1078  Also,  any  relation  between  the  segments  of  a  lino similar  to  that  in  (1015),  in  which  each  letter  occurs  in  every term,  is  a  projective  propertij.  [Proof  as  in  (1056).

Then,  with  any point  0  for  vertex, project  the  quadri- lateral upon  any plane  j'xib  parallel  to GAB.  The  projected figure  jhps  will  be  a parallelogram.
Proof.  —  The planes  OPQ,  OPS  in- tersect in  OA,  and they  intersect  the plane  of  projection which  is  parallel  to 0-1  in  the  lines  pq, r$.  Therefore  pq  and rs  are  parallel  to  OA, and  therefore  to  each other.  Similorlj,  j)"?, qr  are  parallel  to  OB.
230  ELEMENTARY  GEOMETRY.
1080  Cor.  1. — The  opposite  sides  of  the  parallelogram  ji^/rs  meet  in  two points  at  infinity,  which  are  the  projections  of  the  points  A,  R ;  and  AB itself,  which  is  the  third  diagonal  of  the  complete  quadrilateral  FQRS,  is projected  into  a  line  at  infinity.
1081  Hence,  to  project  any  figure  so  that  a  certain  line  in  it  may  pass  to
infinity — Take  the  jilane  of  lirojcdion  'parallel  to  the  plane  which  contains  the given  line  and  the  vertex.
1082  Cor.  2. — To  make  the  projection  of  the  quadrilateral  a  rectangle, it  is  only  necessary  to  make  AOB  a  right  angle.
On  Perspective  Draifing.
1083  Taking  the  parallelogram  pqrs,  in  (1079),  for  the  original  figure, the  quadrilateral  PQRS  is  its  projection  on  the  plane  ABab.  Suppose  this plane  to  be  the  plane  of  the  paper.  Let  the  planes  OAB,  pah,  while remaining  parallel  to  each  other,  be  turned  respectively  about  the  fixed parallel  lines  AB,  ah.  In  evei'y  position  of  the  planes,  the  lines  Oji,  Oq,  Or, Os  will  intersect  the  dotted  lines  in  the  same  points  P,  Q,  R,  S.  When  the planes  coincide  with  that  of  the  paper,  pqrs  becomes  a  ground  pilan  of  the parallelogram,  and  FQRS  is  the  representation  of  it  in  perspective.
AB  is  then  called  the  horizontal  line,  ah  the  picture  line,  and  the  plane  of both  the  picture  plane.
1084  To  find  the  projection  of  any  point  p  in  the  ground plan.
Rule. — Eraw  pb  to  any  point  b  in  the  picture  line,  and  draw  OB  parallel to  pb,  to  meet  the  horizontal  line  in  B  Join  Op,  Bb,  and  they  tvill  intersect  in P,  tJce  point  required.
In  practice,  ph  is  drawn  perpendicular  to  ah,  and  OB  therefore  perpendi- cular to  AB.  The  point  B  is  then  called  the  jjoi;;/  of  sight,  or  centre  of  vision, and  0  the  station  point.
1085  To  find  the  projection  of  a  point  in  the  grojind  plan, not  in  the  original  plane,  but  at  a  perpendicular  distance  c above  it.
Rule. — Take  a  new  picture  line  parallel  to  the  former,  and  at  a  distance above  it  =  c  coseca,  ivhere  a  is  the  angle  hctween  the  original  plane  a)id  the plane  of  p)rojccti(»i.  For  a  plane  through  the  given  ptnnt,  parallel  to  the original  plane,  will  intersect  the  plane  of  projection  in  the  \w\\  picture  line so  constructed.
Thus,  every  point  of  a  figure  in  the  ground  ^dan  is  transferred  to  the drawing.
1086  The  whole  theory  of  perspective  drawing  is  virtually  included  in the  fuicgoing  propositions.  The  original  plane  is  conmionly  horizontal,  aud the  plane  of  pnjiction  vertical.  In  this  case,  cosee  n  =  1,  and  the  height  of iho.  pidure  line  for  any  point  is  equal  to  the  height  of  the  jiuint  itself  above the  original  plane.
The  distance  BO,  when  B  is  the  point  of  sight,  may  be  measured  along A  B,  and  bj)  along  ah,  in  the  opposite  direction}  for  the  lino  Bb  will  continue to  intersect  Oj^  in  the  point  I'.

1089  Areas  are  in  a  constant  ratio  to  their  projections.
For,  lines  parallel  to  the  intersection  of  the  original  pinne  and  the  plane of  projection  arc  unaltered  in  length,  and  lines  at  right  angles  to  the  former are  altered  in  a  constant  ratio.  This  ratio  is  the  ratio  of  the  areas,  and  is the  cosine  of  the  angle  between  the  two  planes.
Projections  of  the  Sphere.
1090  lu  Strreograjyhic  projection,  the  vertex  is  on  the  sur- face of  the  sphere,  and  the  diameter  through  the  vertex  is ])erpendicular  to  the  plane  of  projection  which  passes  through the  other  extremity  of  the  diameter.  The  projection  is  there- fore the  inversion  of  the  surface  of  the  sphere  (lUl2),and  the diameter  is  the  constant  /r.
1091  Ii^  (Uohular  projection,  the  vertex  is  taken  at  a  dis- tance from  the  sphere  equal  to  the  radius  -i- \/2,  and  the diameter  thi'ough  the  vertex  is  perpendicular  to  the  plane  of I)rojection.
1092  In  Gnomon ic  projection,  which  is  used  in  the  construc- tion of  sun-dials,  the  vertex  is  at  the  centre  of  the  sphere.

Th(>  pai'allels  of  lati- tude are  represented  by  right  lines  jierpendicular  to  the meridians,  and  at  increasing  intervals,  so  as  to  preserve  the actual  ratio  between  the  increments  of  longitude  and  latitude at  every  point.
With  r  for  the  radius  of  the  sphere,  the  distance,  on  the  chart,  from  the equator  of  a  point  whose  latitude  is  A,  is    =  r  log  tau  (40*^  +  JX).

GEOMETRICAL    CONICS.
THE  SECTIONS  OF  THE  CONE.
1150  Definitions. — A  Conic  Section  or  Conic  is  the  curve AP  in  which  any  plane  intersects  the  surface  of  a  right  cone.
A  right  cone  is  the  soHd  generated  by  the  revolution  of one  straight  line  about  another  which  it  intersects  in  a  fixed point  at  a  constant  angle.
Let  the  axis  of  the  cone,  in  Fif^.  (1)  or  Fif^.  (2),  be  in  the  plane  of  the paper,  and  let  the  cutting  plane  PMXN  be  perpendicular  to  the  paper.  {L'ead either  the  acce)ited  or  unaccented  letters  tJtrouijhout.)  Let  a  sphere  be  inscribed in  the  cone,  touching  it  in  the  circle  EQF  and  touching  the  cutting  plane  in the  point  S,  and  let  the  cutting  plane  and  the  plane  of  the  circle  EQF  inter- sect in  XM.  The  following  theorem  may  be  regarded  as  the  dfifmbuj  properfij of  the  curve  of  section.
1151  Theorem. — The  distance  of  any  point  P  on  the  conic from  the  point  S,  called  the  focus,  is  in  a  constant  ratio  to FM,  its  distance  from  the  line  XM,  called  the  directrix,  or
FS  :  FM  =  FS'  :  PJ/'  =  AS  :  AX  =  e,   the  eccentricity.
\_See  next  page  for  the  Proif.']
1152  CoK. — The  conic  may  be  generated  in  a  plane  from either  focus  *S',  N',  and  either  directrix  XM,  X'M' ,  by  the  law just  proved.
1153  The  conic  is  an  EJIips^e,  a  Parabola,  or  an  JFi/jjrrhoItt, according  as  e  is  less  than,  equal  to,  or  greater  th.-m  unity. That  is,  according  as  the  cutting  plane  emerges  on  both  sides of  the  lower  cone,  or  is  parallel  to  a  side  of  the  cone,  or  in- tersects both  the  upper  and  lower  cones.
1154  AH  sections  made  by  parallel  planes  are  similar;  for tlie  inclination  of  the  cutting  })lane  determines  the  ratio AI-]  :  AX.
1155  The  limiting  forms  of  the  curve  are  respectively — a circle  when  e  vanishes,  and  two  coincident  right  lines  when  e becomes  infinite.

Because  all  tanjjcnts  from  the  same point  0  or  A,  to  either  sphere  are  equal,  therefore  HE  =  I'Q  =  I'S  and AE=  AS.  Now,  by  (VI.  2),  HE  :  NX  =  AE  :  AX  and  NX  =  PM; therefore  PS  :  P^f  =  AS  :  AX,  a  constant  ratio  denoted  by  e  and  called the  eccentric  ill/  of  the  conic.
Referring  the  letters  either  to  the  ellipse  or  the  hyperbola  in  the subjoined  figuie,  let  C  be  the  middle  point  of  A  A'  and  N  any  other  point  on it.

Proof.— PiV^  =  NP .  NR'  and  PC  =  CD .  CD'  (III.  35,  36).  Also,  by similar  triangles  (VI.  :!,  G),  NR  :  CD  =  AN  I  AC  and  NE'  :  CD'  =  A'N  :  A'C. Multiply  the  last  e(juatiuns  together.

Proof. — The  secants  drawn  through  the  extremities  of  two  parallel  chords meet  on  the  diameter  which  bisects  them  (VI.  4),  and  the  tangents  are  the limiting  positions  of  the  secants  when  the  parallel  chords  coincide.

1202  Diameters  are  mutually  conjugate ;  If  CD  be  parallel to  the  tangent  at  P,  CP  will  be  parallel  to  the  tangent  at  D.

Similarly  for  any  other  chord  Q'O'/  drawn  through  0.

1215  Cor.— The  tangents  from  any  point  to  the  curve  are in  the  ratio  of  the  diameters  parallel  to  them.
For,  when  0  is  without  the  curve  and  the  chords  become  tangents,  each product  of  segments  becomes  the  square  of  a  tangent.
1216  If  from  any  point  Q  on  a  tangent  FT  drawn  to  any conic  (Fig.  1220),  two  perpendiculars  (}R,  QL  be  drawn  to  the focal  distance  PS  and  the  directrix  XM  respectively ;  then
SIl  :  QL  =  c.
Proof.— Since  QU  is  parallel  to  ZS  (1107),  therefore,  by  (VI.  2), SE  :  PS  =QZ:PZ=  QL  :  PM; therefore  SR  :  QL  =  PS  :  PM  =  e.

Proof. — Perpendiculars  from  S,  S'  to  tlic  tancfents  meet  them  in  points y,  Z,  y,  Z',  which  lie  on  the  auxiliary  circle.     Therefore,  by  (II.  5,  ('>)  and

Therefore  W  =  A(T  ±  BCT;     a  constant  value.
Note. — Theorems  (1170),  (1177),  and  (1203)  may  also  be  deduced at  once  for  the  ellipse  by  orthogonal  projection  from  the  circle;  and,  in  all such  cases,  tlie  anahigous  projieity  of  the  hyperbola  may  be  obtained  by  a similar  projection  from  the  rectangular  hyperbola  if  the  property  has  already been  demonstrated  for  the  latter  curve.
1218  n  the  points  A,  S  (Fig.  1102)  be  fixed,  while  C  is moved  to  an  infinite  distance,  the  conic  becomes  a  parabola. Hence,  any  relation  which  has  been  established  for  parts  of the  curve  which  remain  finite,  when  AC  thus  becomes  infinite, qrlJJ  he  a  property  of  the  j^arahoht.

To  draw  the  Ilijperbola.
Make  the  pin  S'  (Fig.  11G2)  serve  as  a  pivot  for  one  end  of  a  bar  of  any convenient  length.

A  pencil  ])oinL  moved  so  as  to  keep  the  thread stretched,  and  touching  the  bar,  will  describe  the  hyperbola,  by  (11G3).

1252  To  find  tlte  axes  and  centre  of  a  given  central  conic.
(i.)  Draw  a  right  line  through  the  centres  of  two  parallel  chords.  This line  is  a  diameter,  by  (1198) ;  and  two  diameters  so  found  will  intersect  in the  centre  of  the  conic.
(ii.)  Describe  a  circle  having  for  its  diameter  any  diameter  PP'  of  the conic,  and  let  the  circle  cut  the  curve  in  Q.  Then  PQ,  P'Q  are  parallel  to the  axes,  by  (1201)  and  (III.  31).
1253     Given  two  conjugate  diameters,  CP,  CD,  in and  magnitude :  to  construct  the  conic.
On  CP  take  PZ  =  Glf'-^CP ;  measuring from  C  in  the  ellipse,  and  towards  C  in  the hyperbola  (Fig.  1188).  A  circle  described through  the  points  C,  Z,  and  having  its centre  0  on  the  tangent  at  P,  will  cut  the tangent  in  the  points  where  it  is  intersected by  the  axes.
Proof. — Analysis:  Let  AC,  BC  cut  the tangent  at  P  in  T,  t.  The  circle  whose diameter  is  Tt  will  pass  through  C  (III.  31), and  will  make
CP. P.^  =  PT.  Pi  (III. 35, 3G)  =  CD' (11 97). Hence  the  construction.

1260  In  tlie  parabola,  tlio  chord  of  curvature  at  P  (Fig. 1250)  drawTi  parallel  to  the  axis,  and  the  one  drawn  through the  focus,  are  each  equal  to  4SF,  the  parameter  of  the  dia- meter at  P  (1241).
Proof.— By  (1258).  The  cliord  parallel  to  the  axis  =QV^-^PV=  4PS (1239)  ;  and  the  two  ehoi'ds  arc  equal  because  they  make  equal  angles  with the  diameter  of  the  circle  of  curvature.
1261  Cor. — The  radius  of  curvature  of  the  parabola  at  P (Fig.  1220)  is  equal  to     2SP'-  ^  SY.
Proof.— (Fig.  1259.)  ^PU  =  ^PI  sec  IPU  =  2SP  BecPST  (Fig.  1221).
1262  The  products  of  the  segments  of  intersecting  chords are  as  the  squares  of  the  tangents  parallel  to  them  (1214-15), (1242-43).
1263  The  common  chords  of  a  circle  and  conic  (Fig.  12G4) are  equally  inclined  to  the  axis  ;  and  conversely,  if  two  chords of  a  conic  are  equally  inclined  to  the  axis,  their  extremities are  concyclic.
Proof. — The  products  of  the  segments  of  the  chords  being  equal  (HI. 35,  36),  the  tangents  parallel  to  them  are  equal  (1262).     Therefore,  by  (1200).
1264  The  common  chord  of  any  conic  and  of  the  circle  of curvature  at  a  point  P,  has  the same  inclination  to  the  axis  as the  tangent  at  P.
Proof. — Draw  any  chord  Qq  parallel to  the  tangent  at  P.  The  circle  circum- Bcribing  PQq  always  passes  through  the same  pointy  (1263),  and  does  so,  there- fore, when  Qq  moves  up  to  P,  and  the circle  becomes  the  circle  of  curvature.
1265  PrvOBLEM. — To  find  the  centre  of  curvature  at  any  given ^oint  of  a  conic.
First  Method. — (Fig.  1261.)  Draw  a  chord  from  the  point  making  the same  angle  with  the  axis  as  the  tangent.  The  perpendicular  bisector  of  the chord  will  meet  the  normal  in  the  centre  of  curvature,  by  (1264)  and  (III.  3).
1266  Second  Method.— Draw  the  normal  PG  and  a  perpendicular  to  it from  il,  meeting  either  of  the  focal  distances  in  Q.  Then  a  perpendicular  to the  focal  distance  drawn  from  Q  will  meet  the  normal  in  0,  the  centre  of curvature.

The  auxiliary  circle  then  becomes  an  ellipse,  of ■which  AC  and  PC  produced  arc  the  equi-conjugatc  diameters.
If  the  entire  figures  be  tlius  deformed,  the  points  on  the  axis  AA'  remain fixed  while  PN,  IJR  describe  the  same  angle.  Hence  CP  remains  parallel  to PT.     CP,  CD  are  therefore  still  conjugate  to  each  other.

THEORY   OF    OPERATIONS.
1483  Let  the  symbols  <^,  ^,  prefixed  to  a  quantity,  «lenoto operations  upon  it  of  the  same  class,  such  as  nudtiplication  or differentiation.  Then  the  law  of  the  operation  is  said  to  be distrUjutice,  when

that  is,  tlie  operation  raay  be  performed  upon  an  undivided quantity,  or  it  may  be  distributed  by  being  performed  upon parts  of  the  quantity  separately  with  the  same  result,
1484  The  law  is  said  to  be  commutative  when
that  is,  the  order  of  operation  may  be  changed,  ^  operating upon  ^x  producing  the  same  result  as  ^  operating  upon  <^x.
1485  ^""^  denotes  the  repetition  of  the  operation  4>  m  times, and  is  equivalent  to  <t>*  ...  a?  to  m  operations.  This  definition involves  the  index  law,
which  merelv  asserts,  that  to  perform  the  operation  n  times  in succession  upon  x,  and  afterwards  m  times  in  succession  upon the  result,  is  equivalent  to  performing  it  m-\-n  times  in  suc- cession upon  X.
1486  The  three  laws  of  Distribution,  Commutation,  and  the law  of  Indices  apply  to  the  operation  of  multiplication,  and also  to  that  of  differentiation  (1411,  '12).  Therefore  any algebraic  transformation  which  proceeds  at  every  step  by  one or  more  of  these  laws  only,  has  a  valid  result  when  for  the operation 'of  muUijjlication  that  of  differentiation  is  sub- stituted.
1487  111  making  use  of  this  principle,  the  symbol  of  dif- ferentiation employed  is   —r-,    or  simply  r/,,  prefixed  to  the
ux
quantity  upon  which   the   operation    of   differentiating  with
respect  to  x  is  to  be  pei-formed.     The  repetition  of  the  opera-
d^       d^         d^ tion  is  indicated  by  -7^,  —r^,    -,    '-,  ^,   &c.,  prefixed  to  the •^     dx^     rt.r     dx^dif
function.  An  abbreviated  notation  is  d^.,  d.y^^,  d.^,  (/o.,.,,^,  &g. Since  d^Xd^  =  dl  in  the  symbolic  operation  of  multiplication, it  will  be  requisite,  in  transferring  the  operation  to  differentia- tion, to  change  all  such  i)idiccs  to  suffixes  when  the  abbreviated notation  is  being  used.
Note. — The  notation  17,,  y^,  w^^a^,  cZa^rSy,  &c.  is  an  innovation.    It  lias,  how- ever, the  recommendations  of  defiuiteness,  simplicity,  and  economy  of  time  in
•writing,  and  of  space  in  printing.     The  expression  -■  .^        requires  at  least
fourteen  distinct  types,  while  its  equivalent  if;,^.;,^    requires  but  seven.     For
THEOIiY  OF  OPEHATloXS.  2Ci7
such  reusous  I  have  introduced  tho  shorLur  notation  experimonUiUy  in  tliuse
pages.  ,    ,    „   
All  such  abbreviated  forms  ofdiffbrential  coefiicienta  as  y'y"y"'...  or  y  //  //..., thou<?h  convenient  in  practice,  are  iucoaiplete  expressions,  because  the  inde- pendent variable  is  not  specified.
The  operation  (f^^iv^  n^d  tho  derived  function  »i^s^,  would  bo  more accurately  represented  by  (./;)J  and  ("l)],  the  index  a.s  usual  indicatinj^  tho repetition  of  the  operation.  JJnt  the  former  notation  is  simpler,  and  it  has the  advantage  of  separating  more  clearly  the  inilex  of  dillerentiation  from  tho index  of  involution.
In  the  symbols  ?/'  and  y^ji  t'lo  figure  2  is  an  index  in  each  case:  in  tho first,  it  shows  the  degree  of  involution ;  in  tho  second,  the  onfrr  of  differentia- tion. The  index  is  omitted  when  the  degree  or  the  order  is  unity,  since  wo ■write  )/  and  //,.
The  sTilUx  takes  precedence  of  the  superfix.  yl  means  the  square  of  y,. djc(,y*)  would  be  written  (//■),  in  this  notation.
As  a  concise  nomenclature  for  all   fundamental   opoi-ations   is   of  great
assistance  in  practice,  the  following  is  recommended :   J^  or  y,  may  be  read "V /or  *,"  as  an  abbreviation  of  the  phrase,  "the  ditfereutial  coefficient  of  (/
71  )2  7S
for,  or  with  respect  to,  .t."     Similarly,  -^,  -j—,  TTTl'  °^  ^^^®  shortened
forms  j/ix,  "xy,  «ix3v,  niay  be  read  '' y  for  two  x,"  ''ii  for  xy,"  ^^u  for  two  x,  three y,"  and  so  forth.
The  distinction  in  meaning  between  the  two  forms  y,,^  and  y„  is  obvious. The  first  (in  which  n  is  numerical  and  ahoays  an  inleijer)  indicates  n  succes- sive diflerentiations  for  x;  the  second  indicates  two  successive  ditierentiations for  the  variables  x  and  z.
The  symbols  -^^  or  y^,  and  -  '{-  or  y^^,   may  be  read,  for  shortness,
"y  for  X  zero,"  "y  for  two  x  zero";  d.^^^^  (^  {xy)  can  be  read  "fZ  for  two  x three  y  of  </>  (xy)."
Although  the  notation  r,  is  already  employed  in  a  tot.illy  dilferent  sense in  the  Calculus  of  Finite  Ditferences,  my  own  experience  is  that  tho  double signification  of  the  symbol  does  not  lead  to  any  confusion:  and  this  for  the very  reason  that  the  two  meanings  are  so  entirely  distinct.  Whenever  tho operation  of  differentiation  is  introduced  along  with  the  subject  of  Finite
Differences,  the  notation     ^    must  of  course  alone  be  employed.
Thus,  in  differentiation,  wo  liavo

TAYLOR'S  THEOREM.— EXPANSION  OF  f{x  +  h),

where  9  is  some  quantity  between  zero  and  unity,  and  n  is any  integer.
Proof.— (i.)  Assume  f(x  +  ]i)  =  A  +  Bh+CP  +  &G. Differentiate  both  sides  of  this  equation, — first  for  x,  and  again  for  /;,— and equate  coefficients  in  the  two  results.
1501  (ii.)  Cox  s  Proof. — Lemma. — Iff(x)  vanishes  when  a;  t:=  a,  and  also when  x—h,  and  if  f(x)  and  f'(x)  are  continuous  functions  between  the same  limits  ;  then  f'(x)   vanishes  for  some  value  of  a;  between  a  and  h.
For /'('■)  must  change  sign  somewhere  between  the  assigned  limits  (see proof  of  1403),  and,  being  continuous,  it  must  vanish  in  passing  from  plus  to minus.
1502  Now,  the  expression
f(a  +  x)-^fia)-xf'(a)-   -  j^/"  00
-^'=[/(-+/0-/(«)-V''(«)— -|^/"(")}
vanishes  when  x  =  0  and  when  x=h.  Therefore  the  differential  coefficient with  respect  to  x  vanishes  for  some  value  of  x  between  0  and  h  by  the  lemma. Let  dh  be  this  value.  Differentiate,  and  apply  the  lemma  to  the  resulting expression,  which  vanishes  when  x  =  0  and  when  .e  =  06h.  Perform  the pame  process  n+l  times  successively,  writing  Oh  for  Odii,  etc.,  since  0  merely stands  for  some  quantity  less  than  unity.     The  ivsult  shews  that

The  theorem  may  be  extended  to  any  quautic,  the  quan- tities on  the  right  remaining  unaltered.  Thus,  in  a  ternary quantic  u  of  the  n^^'  degree,

Definitions.
1626  The  Elhninant  of  n  quantics  in  n  variables  is  the function  of  the  coefficients  obtained  by  putting  all  the  quantics equal  to  zero  and  eliminating  the  variables  (583,  586).
1627  The  Discriminant  of  a  quantic  is  the  eliminant  of  its first  derivatives  with  respect  to  each  of  the  variables  (Ex. 1631).
1628  An  Invariant  is  a  function  of  the  coefficients  of  an equation  whose  value  is  not  altered  by  linear  transformation of  the  equation,  excepting  that  the  function  is  multiplied  by the  modulus  of  transformation  (Ex.  1632).
1629  A  Covariant  is  a  quantic  derived  from  another  quautic, and  such  that,  when  both  are  subjected  to  the  same  linear transformation,  the  resulting  quantics  are  connected  by  the same  process  of  derivation  (Ex.  1634).
1630  A  Hessian  is  the  Jacobian  of  the  first  derivatives  of  a function.
Thus,   the  Hessian  of  a  ternary  quantic   u,  whose   first
derivatives  are  li^,  n.

1632  The  determinant  is  also  an  invariant  of  u,  by  (1G38)  ;  that  is,  if  u bo  transfDrmed  into  v  by  putting  x  =  nl^fii)  and  //  =  n'£-|-/3'»/;  and,  if  a corresponding  (h;terniinant  be  formed  with  tlie  cocilicients  of  r,  the  new determinant  will  be  equal  to  the  original  one  multiplied  by  (u/3'  — a'/3)\

where  A',  =  a,a;  +  h^H  +  c^z  +  &c.
The  derivatives  u„  u^,  &c.  must  contain  one  of  the  fjiotors  XjX,  ...  X,,.,  in every  term,  and  therefore  must  have,  for  common  roots,  the  roots  of  the simultaneous  equations  X,  =  U,  X.^  —  0,  ...  X,,.,  =  0  ;  u-l  equations  being required  to  determine  the  ratios  of  the  n  variables.  Therefore  the  dis- criminant of  a,  whicli  (lGl2")  is  the  eliminaut  of  the  equations  Hr  =  0,  n^  =  0, &c.,  vanishes,  by  (oS8).
1636  <^^<"^-  1- — If  '^  binary  quantic  contains  a  square  factor, the  discriminant  vanishes  ;  and  conversely.
Thus,  in  E.xample  (1G31),  if  u  has  a  factor  of  the  form  {Ax  +  J)i,')'-,  the deterniinaut  there  written  vanishes.
1637  Cor.  2. — If  any  quadric  is  resolvable  into  two  factors, the  discriminant  vanishes.
An  independent  proof  is  as  follows: —
Let  M  =  Xy  be  the  quadric,  where
X=  {ax  +  by  +  cz+...),  Y=  (ax  +  h'y  +  c'z+...).
The  derivatives  u^,  u^,  u.  are  each  of  the  form  i>X-\-qY,  and  therefore  have for  common  roots  the  roots  of  the  simultiineous  equations  X  =  0,  F=0. Therefore  the  eliminant  of  u^  =  U,   u^  =  0,   &c.  vanishes  (IG27).
1638  The  discriminant  of  a  binary  quantic  is  an  invariant.
Pkoof. — A  square  factor  remains  a  square  factor  after  linciir  (ransforma- tion.  Hence,  by  (1G3G),  if  the  discriminant  vanishes,  the  discriminant  of the  transformed  equation  vanishes,  and  must  thenforo  contain  the  former discriminant  as  a/«r/or  (see  1G28).

The  result  is
(/,  =  {aJ^  +  h(-.J.)]^M;      -d,=  {a'dr,  +  h'(-dt)}^M   (ii),
where  M  =  ah'  —  a'h,  tlie  modulus  of  i ransformation.  Etjuations  (i.)  and  (ii.) are  parallel,  and  show  tiiat  the  operations  d^  and  —d^  can  be  transformed  in the  same  way  as  the  (juanlilies  x  and  // ;  that  is,  if  9  (a;,  ?/)  becomes  v/*  (I,  n), then  f(d^,  — (/,)  becomes  v/- (</,, ,  —  Jf  ) -f- J/",  where  71  is  the  degree  of  the quantic  0.  But  ^  (d^,  — c7,)  0  (.c,  //)  is  a  function  of  the  coefficients  only  of the  quantic  0,  since  the  order  of  differentiation  of  each  term  is  the  same  as  the degree  of  the  term  ;  therefore  the  function  is  an  invariant,  by  definition  (1628).
1649  Example. — Let  0  {x,  y)  —  ax*+bx^i/  +  ex!i^+fy*.  The  quantic  must first  be  completed;  thus,  f  (xy)  =  ax*  +  bx^y  +  cx-y^-\-exy'^+fy\  {c  =  0)  ;  then <p  (d^,  -J,)  f  (x,  y)  =  (uti,,  — 5t?3j,z  +  cc/2y2x— «^!,ax+/(?4x)  9  (a;,  y)
=  a.2if-h.Ge  +  cAc-e.{Jb+f.2~ki  =  4:(l-2af-dhe  +  c"). Therefore  12af-Sbe-\-c-  is  an  invariant  of  ^,  and  =  {\2AF-^BE +  C^)-i-M*, ■where  A,  B,  C,  E,  F  are  the  coefficients  of  any  equation  obtained  from  ^  by  a linear  transformation.
But  if  the  degree  of  the  quantic  be  odd,  these  results  vanish  identically.
1650  Similarly,  if  (p(,r,y),  ^P  {x,  ij)  are  two  qualities  of  tho same  degree,  the  functions
<t>{fI,,-(L.)rl^{.v,i/)     and     rp{d,,-(l.,)<t>i.r,,,) are  both  invariants.

two  functions  are  ^11"^'>3)  and  'l^W'il  (1^30).     Kow d  (xyz)  d  (i»/;')

The  second  transformation  is  .seen  at  once  from  the  form  of  the  determi- nant by  merely  transposing  rows  and  ci)lumns;  the  first  and  third  are  by theorem  (l()04j.  Theret'ore,  by  definition  (itJ2'J),  the  llessiau  of  tt  is  a covariant.
1653  Coij^rcdicnts. — Variables  are  cogredient  when  they  are subjected  to  the  same  linear  transformation  ;  thus,  .r,  ;/  are

1654  Emancnts. — If  iu  any  quantic  2i  =  (p  {x,  ij),  we  change X  into  x-\-px' ,  and  y  into  y-\-py',  where  x  ,  y'  are  cogredient Tvith  X,  y;  then,  by  (1512),
<l>(.r-\-p.v',y+py') =  n-\-p  (x'd,-[-y'dy)  u-\-iy  (.rV/,+//V/,)-  m  +  &c.,
and  the  coefficients  of  p,  p^,  p^,  ...  are  called  the  first,  second, third,  ...  emanents  of  u.
1655     The  emanents,  of  the  typical  form  {x  d^-[-y' dyY  u,  are all  covariants  of  the  quantic  u.
Proof. — If,  in   0  (.r,  y),    we  first  make  the  substitutions  wliich  lead  to  the emanent,  and  afterwards  make  the  cogredient  substitutions,  we  change
X  into  x-\-px',  and  this  into    a$+ J»;  +  |0  (a£'+ 6»?'). And  if  the  order  of  these  operations  be  reversed,  we  change
cc  into  al-^-hri,  and  this  into   ail-\-pt)+l>  {r)-\-prjf). The  two  results  are  identical,  and  it  follows  that,  if  ^  {x,  y)  be  transformed by  the  same  operations  in  reversed  order,  the  coefficients  of  the  powers  of  p in  the  two  expansions  will  be  equal,  since  p  is  indeterminate.     Therefore,  by the  definition  (ltJ21>),  each  emanent  is  a  covariant.

1705  K  (,'//)  =  (^,,//^+;?(^,,...//:.+i?<^,.,.//.+<^3x.
1706  In  these  formnlff!  tlie  notation  <f>^  is  used  where  the  difforentiation is  partial,  while  ^^(.r,  y)  is  used  to  denote  the  complete  derivative  of  (}>(x,y) with  respect  to  x.  Each  successive  partial  derivative  of  the  function  ^((/,  z) (1700)  is  itself  treated  as  a  function  ol'  ij  and  z,  and  differentiated  as  such  by formula  (14-20).
Thus,  the  differentiation  of  the  product  cp^y^  in  (170(1)  produces
The  function  <p^  involves  y  and  z  by  implication.  If  it  should  not  in  fact contain  z,  lor  instance,  then  the  partial  derivative  0„,  vanishes.  On  the  other hand,  y^,  y,^,  &c.  are  independent  of  z;  and  z^,  Zjj.,  &c.  are  independent  of?/,
DERIVED  EQUATIONS.
1707  If  ^  (•''7/)  =  0,  its  successive  derivatives  are  also  zero, and  the  expansions  (1708-5)  are  then  called  i\\Q  firt^t,  second^ and  third  derived  equations  of  tlie  primitive  equation  ^(.r//)  =  0.
In  this  case,  those  equations  give,  by  eliminating  //j.,

Proof.— Bj  (1708),  ^,  =  0.  Therefore  (1704)  and  (J70o)  give  these values  of  t/o,  and  y^,.
201  BIFFEUENTIAL  CALCULUS.
1713  If  </'a-  f^Tid  (\>y  botli  vanisli,  7/.^  in  (1708)  is  indeterminate. In  tins  cape  it  has  two  values  given  by  the  second  derived equation  (170  I),  which  becomes  a  quadratic  in  y^.
1714  If  <\>-i.ri  fl>.r,n  and  (poy  also  vanish,  proceed  to  the  third derived  equation  (1705),  which  now  becomes  a  cubic  in  y^, giving  three  values,  and  so  on.
1715  Generally,  when  all  the  partial  derivatives  of  (j>  {,r,  y)  of orders  less  than  n  vanish  for  certain  values  x  =  a,  y  =  h,  we have,  by  (1512),  <}>{a,  h)  being  zero,
i>  {a  +  h,  h  +  Jc)  =  —  (/<4  +  K)"'^  (A'i/).a,i+  terms    of
higher  orders  which  may  be  neglected  in  the  limit,  {x,  y  are here  put  =  a,h  after  differentiation.)  Now,  with  the  notation of  1406),  H..a-\-Hv.b  =  0;
therefore  JL  =  -t^  =  ']!.;
the  values  of  which  are  therefore  given  by  the  equation
1716  ihcl  +  kd,Y<l>{.r,y),^,,=  0.
1717  If  Vjc  becomes  indeterminate  through  x  and  y  vanish- ing, observe  that  -^  —  ^L  in  this  case,  and  that  the  value  of

the  latter  fraction  may  often  be  more  readily  determined  by algebraic  methods.
If  X  and  y  in  the  function  (j)  [x,  y)  are  connected  by  the equation  \p  (x,  y)  =  0,  y  is  thereby  made  an  impHcit  function of  X,  and  we  have

IMPLICIT  FUNCTIONS  OF  TWO  INDEPENDENT  VARIABLES.
1725  If  the  equation  <p  {.v,  y,  z)  =  0  alone  be  given,  y  may be  considered  an  imj)licit  function  of  .r.  and  ;:.  Since  .r  and  z are  independent,  we  may  make  z  constant  and  differentiate for  ■/';  thus,  for  a  variation  in  x  only,  tlie  ecjuations  (1703-5) are  produced  again  with  ^  (Xyy,z)  in  the  ])lace  of  <p  (.'',//).
1726  It"  ■'■  he  made  constant,  z  must  replace  x  in  those  ecpia- tions  as  the  independent  variable.
Again,  by  differentiating  the  equation  <p{ryz)  =  0  first  for :r,  making  z  constant,  and  the  result  for  z,  making  x  constant,

1729  If  3S,  Ih  -  i^^  tlie  function  <^(,f,  //,  2)  be  connected  by  the relation  i/-  (,r,  //, ::)  =  0,  //  may  be  taken  as  a  function  of  two independent  variables  x  and  ;?.  A¥e  may  therefore  make  z constant,  and  the  values  of  f^  {.r,  y,  z)  and  «^2.r  (^\  Ih  ^')  are identical  with  those  in  (1718,  '19)  if  x,  y,  z  be  substituted  for a?,  y  in  each  function.
1730  By  changing  x  into  ;:  the  same  formula  give  the values  of  ^,  (,2",  y,  z)  and  ^o.  (-f,  7/,  ,;•).
1731  On  the  same  hypothesis,  if  the  value  of  <^^  {x,  y, ,?),  in forming  which  z  has  been  made  constant,  be  now  differen- tiated for  z  while  x  is  made  constant,  each  partial  derivative ^j.,  xpy,  &G.  in  (1718)  must  be  differentiated  as  containing  x,  y, and  z,  of  which  three  variables  x  is  now  constant  and  y  is  a function  of  z.
The  result  is
1732  f.(.r,,v,=:)  =  {(<l>..,<!,-^...,4'M-{hA,-^:,A,HAl
In  a  particular  instance  it  is  generally  easier  to  apply  such  rules  for differentiating  directly  to  the  example  proposed,  than  to  deduce  the  result  in a  functional  form  for  the  purpose  of  substituting  in  it  the  values  of  the  partial derivatives.

1807  Extending  the  definition  in  (1020),  it  follows  that  any function  ?<  =  (/)(./•,  //,  ::),  wlien  orthogonally  transformed,  has, for  a  covariant,  the  function  <|)  {<lj,,  d^,  d,)  n.  That  is,  if  by the  transformation,

But    t'oj.  =  2,    and    v,,,  =  0,    &c.      Hence    the    theorem    gives    a-\-'b-)rC =  a'  +  i'  +  c';  in  other  words,  a-\-h  +  c  is  an  invariant.
1813  Contrnfiredicnt.  —  AVhen  the  transformation  is  not orthogonal,  (1795)  shows  that  d^.  is  not  transformed  by  the same,  but  by  a  reciprocal  substitution,  in  which  %,  &i,  c^  are replaced  by  the  corresponding  minors  A-^,  B^,  Oj.  In  this  case d^,  dy,  dg  are  said  to  be  contragredicnt  to  a',  ^,  z.
1814  Contravariant. — If,  in  (1G29),  the  quantics  are  sub- jected to  a  reciprocal  transformation  instead  of  the  same,  we obtain  the  definition  of  a  contravariant.

But  «/.  (.r,  //,  z)  =  0  is  equivalent  to  \p  (x,  y)—z  =  0;  and  the  partial derivatives  of  (p  with  respect  to  x  and  y  are  the  same  as  those  of  \p  ;  and therefore  the  same  as  those  uf  z  when  x  and  y  are  the  independent  variables.

The  independent  variable  is  here  changed  from  z  to  x,  without  reference to  the  equation  9  =  0;  and  this  is  allowable,  because  y  is  constant  for  the time  being  in  either  case.

1832     Rule  I. — A  function  </>  (x)  is  a  maximum  or  minimum when  (p' (x)  vanishes^  and  chanfjcs  its  siijn  as  x  increases  from

1833  Rule  II. — Otherwise  <|>  (x)  is  a  maximum  or  minimum ivlien  an  odd  number  of  consecutive  derivatives  of  </>  (x)  vanish, and-  the  next  is  minus  or  plus  respectively.
Pj^OOF. — (i.)  The  tangent  to  the  curve  in  the  last  figure  becomes  parallel to  the  X  axis  at  the  points  A,  B,  C,  B,  E  as  x  increases ;  therefore,  by  (U03), tan  6,  which  is  equal  to /(.!•),  vanishes  at  those  points,  while  its  sign  changes in  the  manner  described.
(ii.)  Let  /"(,«)  be  the  first  derivative  of /(.?')  which  does  not  vanish  when a;  =  a,  n  being  even;  therefore,  by  (1500),  /(a  ±70  =  f{a)+  ^-^f'{a^Hh).
The  last  term  retains  the  sign  of /"(a),  when  7;  is  small  enontrh,  whether  h be  positive  or  negative,  since  n  is  even.  Therefore  f  {x)  diiiiini.shes  for  any small  variation  of  a;  from  the  value  a  if /"(a)  be  negative,  but  increases  if /"(a)  be  positive.     Hence  the  rule.
1834  Note.  —  Before  applying  the  rule  for  discovering  a maximum  or  minimum,  Ave  may  evidently —
(i.)  reject  any  constant  factor  of  the  function  ;
(ii.)  raise  it  to  any  constant  poioer, paying  attention  to  sign; (iii.)  tahe  its  reciprocal ;  maximum  becoming  minimum,  and
vice  versa  ; (iv.)   tahe  the  logarithm  of  a  positive  function.
1835  Ex.  1.— Let        <p  {x)  =  x'-7x*-d5x  +  l, therefore  f  Oe)  =  T.^^- 28a;» -  35  =  7  (x'-5)  (,r^  + 1) .
Also  (j)"(x)  =  7(6x^  —  l2x^).  Therefore  a;  =  V5  makes  ^'(.v)  vanish,  and f"(x)  positive;  and  therefore  makes  (p(x)  a  minimum.
1836  Ex.  2.— Let        <i>(x)  =  (x-2y'(x-2y\     Here
f  (ao  =  u(,x-^y'(x-2y'+u(x-sy\x-2y'={x-sy\x-2y\2r>x-6i),
and  we  know,  by  (444)  or  by  (14G0),  that,  when  x  =  S,  the  first  thirteen derivatives  of  ^  (c)  vanish  ;  and  13  is  an  odd  number.  Therefore  0  (x)  is either  a  maximum  or  minimum  when  «  =  3.
To  determine  which,  examine  the  change  of  sign  in  (^'(x).  Now  (,r  — 3)" changes  from  negative  to  positive  as  a:  increases  from  a  value  a  little  less than  3  to  a  value  a  little  greater,  while  the  other  factors  of  <p' (x)  remain positive.     Therefore,  by  the  rule,  cp  (a;)  is  a  minimum  when  a-  =  3.
Again,  as  x  passes  through  the  vakie  2,  0' (x)  does  not  change  sign,  10 being  even.     Therefore  x  —  2  gives  no  maximum  or  mininuim  value  ot  0  [x).
Lastly,  as  x  passes  through  the  value  -*.-    the  signs  of  the  three  factors
in  <p'(x)  change  from  (-)  (  +  )(  —  )  to  (  —  )(  +  )(  +  );  that  is,  (/.'(•«')  changes from  +  to  —  ;  and,  consequently,  f  (a;)  is  a  maximum.

Hence,  as  in  the  proof  of  (1833),  in  order  that  changinc^  the  sign  of/;  or Tc  shall  not  have  the  elYect  of  changing  the  sign  of  tlie  right  side  of  the  equa- tion, tlie  first  powers  must  disappear,  tlierefore  f^  and  ^y  must  vanish.  The next    terra    may    be    written,    by   completing    the    square,    in    the    form

sign  for  all  values  of  the  ratio  h  :  /.-,  AC—B^  must  be  positive.  ^  will  then be  a  maximum  or  minimum  according  as  A  in  the  denominator  is  negative or  positive.
It  is  clear  that  A  and  B  might  have  been  transposed  in  the  proof.  Hence B  must  have  the  same  sign  as  A.

The  criterion  of  maximum  or  minimum  in  (1842)  may  also  be  applied ■without  eliminating  y  by  employing  the  values  of  (j>2x  and  <p-,.  in  (1719,  '30).

Hence,  for  constancy  of  sign  for  all  values  of  E,  »?,  i^,  it  is  necessary  that  G and  liC—F'^  should  be  positiVe.  Tliis  makes  B  also  positive.  By  symmetry, it  is  evident  that  A,  B,  G,  BG—F",  CA-G',  AB-R-  will  all  be  positive. The  sign  of  a  in  tlic  first  factor  then  determines,  as  in  (1842),  whether  ^  is  a maximum  or  a  minimum.
1855  The  condition  may  be  put  otherwise.  Since BG—F'  =  a/^  by  (577),  the  condition  that  BG'—F"-  must  be positive  is  equivalent  to  the  condition  that  a  and  A  must  have the  same  sign.     Hence  we  have  also  the  following  rule  : —

INTRODUCTION.
1900  The  operations  of  different laf ion  mid  integration  are the  converse  of  each  other.  Let  /'(/*•)  be  the  dm-ivative  of </)(.7;);  then  «/>(./■)  is  called  the  integral  oif(x)  with  respect  to  x. These  converse  relations  are  expressed  in  the  notations  of  the Differential  and  Integral  Calculus,  by
!Mii  =/(,,.)    and  by    \f{,r)  ,/.,■  =  ^  (.,).
1901  Theorem. — Let  the  curve  y  =f(,r)  be  drawn  as  in (1403),  and  any  ordinates  LI,  Mm,  and  let  OL  =  a,  OM=b; then  the  area  LMuil  =  <p(l>)  —  <p{a).
Proof. — Let  OX  be  any  value  of  x,  and  PN the  corresponding  value  of  y,  and  let  the  area ONPQ  =  A  ;  then  ^1  is  sunie/iniction  of  x.  Also, if  NN'=(lx,  the  elemental  area  NN'FP  =  dA
=  ydx  in  the  limit ;  therefore  — -  =  y.     Thus  A ax
is  that  function  of  x  whose  derivative  for  each
value  of  X  is  y  or  f{x)  ;  therefore  A  =  (f>  (x)  +  C,
where  C  is  any  constant.    Consequently  the  area
LM)nl  =  <})  (i)  — v>  («).  whatever  C  may  be.
The  demonstration  assumes  that  there  is  onl}'  one  function  f  (r)  corres- ponding to  a  given  derivative /(x).     TliLs  may  bo  formally  proved.
If  possible,  let  \l^(x)  have  the  same  derivative  as  <{>(-r);  then,  with  tlio same  coordinate  axes,  two  curves  may  bo  drawn  so  that  the  areas  detined  jw febove,  Hke  LMinl,  shall  be  (j>{.r)  and  \p(.i-)  respectively,  each  area  vanishing with  x.  If  these  curves  do  not  coiiieide,  tiien,  lor  a  given  value  of  x,  they have  different  ordinates,  that  is,  f  (x)  and  4^'  i-^)  are  different,  contrary  to  the hypothesis.  The  curves  must  therefore  coincide,  that  is,  9  (x)  and  ^  (x)  aru idtutit'al.

1902  Since  <p(h)  —  (\>{a)  is  the  sum  of  all  the  elemental  areas like  NN'P'P  included  between  LI  and  Mm,  that  is,  the  sum  of the  elements  ydx  or  /(.-r)  d.v  taken  for  all  values  of  x  between a  and  h,  this  result  is  ^Titten
f/(.r)rf..  =  .^(6)-.^(«).
1903  The  expression  on  the  left  is  termed  a  definite  integral because  the  hmits  a,  h  of  the  integration  are  assigned.* Wlien  the  limits  are  not  assigned,  the  integral  is  called  inde- finite.
1904  By  taking  the  constant  (7=:0  in  (1901),  we  have  the
area  ONPQ  =  4>  (.r)  =  (/(.r)  dv.

is  used  to  denote  the  following  operations.
Integrate  the  function  for  z  between  the  limits  2  =  ^i,  z^z^, considering  the  remaining  variables  x  and  y  constant.  Then, whether  the  limits  z^,  z.^  are  constants  or  functions  of  x  and  t/, the  result  will  be  a  function  of  x  and  //  only.  Next,  consider- ing X  constant,  integrate  this  function  for  y  between  the  limits 7/i  and  7/2»  which  may  either  be  constants  or  functions  of  x. The  result  will  now  be  a  function  of  x  only.  Lastly,  integrate this  function  for  x  between  the  limits  x^  and  x^_.
Similarly  for  a  function  of  any  number  of  variables.
1906  The  clearest  view  of  the  nature  of  a  multiple  integral is  afforded  by  the  geometrical  interpretation  of  a  triple  in- tegral.

Proof. — Since  tlie  volume  cnt  off"  by  any  plane  parallel  to  OYZ^  and  at  a distance  x  iVom  it,  varies  continuously  with  r,  it  must  be  smue J'nnct'ioti.  of  x.

wlicre  z  is  equal  to/(.T),  some  function  cliosen  so  as  to  facili- tate the  integration.
Rule  I. — Put  x  in  terms  of  z  in  the  given  function,  and multiply  the  function  also  by  x^;   then  integrate  for  z.
If  the  limits  of  the  proposed  integral  are  given  by  x  =  a, X  =  b,   these  mast  be  converted  into  limits  ofz  by  the  equation

METHODS  OF  IXTECHATIoX.  31
In  Examples  (2)  ami  (3)  the  process  is  analytical,  and  leads  to  the  dis- covery of  the  particular  fiuietioii  ;:,  wifli  respect  to  which  tlie  intejrrution  is effected.  U  z  be  known,  Ride  1.  supplies  the  direct,  thoujjh  not  always  tho simplest,  method  of  integrating  the  function.
INTEGRATION   \)Y  PARTS.
1910  T\v  differentiating  7(V  with  respect  to  ./',  we  obtain  tlio
general  formula       \  i(,r(Lv  =  iir  —  \  ur.d.v.
The  value  of  the  fii-st  integral  is  thus  determined  if  that of  the  second  is  known.
Rule.  —  Separate  the  quantity  to  he  integrated  into  two factor.^i.  Integrate  one  factor,  and  differentiate  the  other  with \'esprct  to  X.  If  the  integral  of  tlie  resulting  quantity  is known,  or  more  readily  ascertained  than  that  of  the  original one,  the  method  by  "  Parts"  is  applicable.
1911  Note.  —  In  subsequent  examples,  where  integration  by  Parts  ia directed,  the  factor  which  is  to  be  integrated  will  be  indicated.  Thus,  in example  (10-">1),  "By  Parts  |6'"'(/.c"  signifies  that  e"  is  to  be  integrated  and sin  h.c  differentiated  afterwards  in  applying  the  foregoing  rule.  The  factor  1  is more  frequently  integrated  than  any  other,  and  this  step  will  be  denoted  by  \dx.
INTEGRATION  BY  DIVISION.
1912  A  formula  is
^{a+hry  d.v  =  a  ({a  +  Lv"y-'  +  h  f.r"  («  +  />.<•")"-'  d.r  :
The  expression  to  be  integrated  is  thus  divided  into  two  terras, the  index  p  in  each  being  diminished  by  unity,  a  step  which often  facilitates  integration.
Similarly,  j  (a  +  bx"  +  ex'")''  dx
=  a  (a  +  hx"  +  cx'"y-^  +  hx"  (a  +  i.c"  +  cj;'")''-'  +  ex'"  (a  +  hx" +  cx''-y-\
1913  Ex.— To  integrate       \^(x'  +  n')dx.
By  Parts    |  J.r,        |  y  (.r'  +  cr)  dx  =  x  ^ (.."  +  a')  -  |  -^f^^^y

Therefore,  by  addition,

INTEGRATION  BY  RATIONALIZATION.
1914  In  tlie  following  example,  6  is  tlie  least  common  de- nominator of  the  fractional  indices.  Hence,  by  substituting z  =  x^,  and  therefore  x^  =  Oz^,  we  have
z^-l  dx  '•-'-

Each  term  of  the  result  is  directly  integrable  by  (1922)  and (1923).     For  other  examples  see  (2110).
INTEGRATION  BY  PARTIAL  FRACTIONS.
1915  Rational  fractions  can  always  be  integrated  by  first resolving  them  into  partial  fractions.  The  theory  of  such resolutions  will  now  be  given.
1916  If  </>('^0  and  F{x)  are  rational  algebraic  functions  of  x, <}>{x)  being  of  lowest  dimensions,  and  if  F  {x)  contains  the factor  {x  —  a)  once,  so  that
F(a>)-(.r-«)t/,Gi')   (1);
1917  «.n|«  =  _l_  +  |gana^  =  iM   (,,
Proof. — Multiply  equation  (2)  by  (I),  thus
(j>  (x)  =  A4^  {x)  +  (x-a)x  (x). Therefore,  putting  x  =  a,  (p  (a)  =  A4^  (a).     Also,  by  differentiating  (1),  and putting  x  =  a  afterwards,   F' (a)  =  \p  (a).     Therefore  A  =  <p  (a)  -^  F'((i).
1918  Again,  if  F{x)  contains  the  factor  (x  —  a),  n  times,  so that  F{d^  =  (.{—«)"</»  Or).

"When  other  methods  are  not  applicable,  an  integral  may sometimes  be  evahiated  by  expanding  the  function  in  a  con- verging series  and  integrating  the  separate  terms.

2056  To  find    f  ^'^p'^^  dx.     Apply  Rule  I.  or  Formula  I. ;  thus ^x-'(a'-x-)hlx  =  -lx-\a'-x'y-  +  l  ^x'' (ar-or)-^  dx  (1927).
2057  To  find   I   — -dx.     Apply  Rule  II.  or  Formula  II. ;  thus
^x'  (a'-x'yUx  =  a^a'-x'r'-S ^ x'  (a'-x'r^  dx     (1934).

Apply  Rule  HI. ;  thus,  increasing  j^  by  1  and  integrating,  first  by  Parts \x'"'  dx,  and  again  by  Division  ;

By  repeating  the  process,  the  integral  is  made  to  depend  finally  upon

If  n  be  an  odd  integer,  we  arrive,  finally,  by  successive reduction  in  this  manner,  at    \  {(i'^-\-,r)^  d^v    (1031).
2066  The  integral  j'sin'"0  cos^Oc/0  is  reducible  by  the  fore- going Rules  I.  to  VI.,  if,  in  applying  them,  n  he  ahrays  put equal  to  2;  if  p  be  changed  info  p±2  iuiitead  of  p±l;  nnd if  Division  he  always  effected  by  separating  the  factor cos-e  =  l-sin^e.
Proof.     Jsin"  0  cosPOf/fl  =  J  x"'(l-a:')*  "-'  (/.r,   where  .>•  =  sin  fl.     Thus n  =  2  always,  and  the  index  i  (jJ  — 1)  is  increased  by  1  by  adding  2  to  p.

Similarly  in  the  case  of  any  number  of  independent  variables.
When,  however,  the  limits  in  the  transformed  integral have  to  be  discovered  from  the  given  equations,  the  process is  not  so  simple.
In  the  first  place,  we  shall  show  how  to  change  the  order of  integration  merely.

The  right  member  will  generally  consist  of  more  than  one  integral,  and  S denotes  their  sum.  The  limits  of  the  integration  for  x  may  be,  one  or  both, constants,  or,  one  or  both,  functions  of  y.  ^  is  the  inverse  of  the  function  \p, and  is  obtained  by  solving  the  equation  y  =  i//(.x'),  so  that  x  =■  ^(^).  Simi- larly with  regard  to  (p  and  4>.
An  examination  of  the  solid  figure  described  in  (1907),  whose  volume this  integral  represents,  will  make  the  matter  clearer.  The  integration,  the order  of  which  has  to  be  changed,  extends  over  an  area  which  is  the  projec- tion of  the  solid  upon  the  plane  of  xy,  and  which  is  bounded  by  the  two straight  lines  x  =  a,   x  =  h,   and  the  two  curves   y  =  '4^  (.^')>   V  =  'p(x)-
The  summation  of  the  elements  PQ.qp  extends  from  a  to  h,  and  includes in  the  one  integral  on  the  left  of  equation  (i.)  the  whole  of  the  solid  in question.
But,  on  the  right,  the  different  integrals  represent  the  summation  of elements  like  PQ^^rj),  but  all  pai^allel  to  OX,  between  planes  y  =  a,  y  =  fi,  &c. drawn  through  points  where  the  limits  of  x  change  their  character  on  account of  the  boundaries  y  =  \p{x),  y  =  cp  (x)  not  being  straight  lines  parallel to  OX.

Let  y  =  cp  (x)  have  a  ruaxinium  value  when  x  =  c. The  values  of  y  at  this  point  will  be  ^(c),  and  at  the points  where  the  straight  lines  meet  the  curves  the values  will  be  (p(a),  <P\h),  i// (a),  v/'(fc).

2777     To  change  the  order  of  integration  in  a  triple  integral, from  z,  y,  x  to  y,  x,  z,  we  shall  have  an  equation  of  the  form
F  {x,  y,  z)  dx  dy  dz  =  I.\      \                        F  (x,  y,  z)  dz  dx  dy ixii^i{x)}4>i(x,y)  J 2^1  J  ^1 U)  J *i  (c, a-)    (ii.)
Here  the  most  general  form  for  the  integrals  whose  sum  is  indicated  b}^  2 is  that  in  which  thf  limits  of  y  are  functions  of  z  and  x,  the  limits  of  a;  func- tions of  z,  and  the  limits  of  z  constant.  Referring  to  the  figure  in  (lOOG), the  total  value  of  the  integral  is  equivalent  to  the  following.  Every  element dxdydz  of  the  solid  described  in  (1907)  is  multiplied  by  F(xyz),  a  function of  the  coordinates  of  the  element,  and  the  sum  of  the  products  is  taken.
This  process  is  indicated  by  one  triple  integral  on  the  left  of  equation  (ii ) ; the  limits  of  the  integration  for  z  being  two  unrestricted  curved  surfaces 2  =  <^i (x,  y),  z  =  02  (x,  y)  ;  the  limits  for  ?/,  two  cylindrical  surfaces  y  =  4^i{x), y  =  \p2  (^)  ;  ^■^d  the  limits  for  x,  two  planes  x  =  a'j,  x  =  x.^.
But,  with  the  changed  order  of  integration,  several  integrals  may  be required.  The  most  general  form  which  any  of  them  can  take  is  that  shown on  the  right  of  equation  (ii.)  Solving  the  equation  z  =  0,  (.'',  y),  let ?/,  =  <l>j  (z,  x),  ?/,,  =  <t.,  (z.  x)  be  two  resulting  values  of  y  ;  then  the  integra- tion for  y  may  be  efiected  between  these  limits  over  all  parts  of  the  solid where  tlie  surface   z  =  (pi  (x,  y)  is  cut  twice  by  the  same  y  coordinate.
The  next  integration  is  with  respect  to  a;,  and  is  limited  by  the  cylindrical surface,  whose  generating  lines,  parallel  to  OY,  touch  the  surface  z  =  fi{x,  y). At  the  ])oints  of  contact,  x  will  have  a  maximum  or  minimum  value  for  each value  of  z  ;  therefore  J^^j  (a;,  ;/)  =  0.  Eliminating  y  between  this  equation and  that  of  the  surface,  we  get  x  =  4',  (z),  x  =  "ir^  (z)    for  the  limits  of  .t.
Lastly,  th.e  result  of  the  previous  summations  is  integrated  for  z  between two  parallel  planes  «  =  z,,  z  =  Zj,  drawn  so  as  to  include  all  that  portion  of the  solid  over  which  the  limits  for  x  and  y,  already  dotermiued,  remain  the Bame.
TBANSFOBMATION  OF  A  MULTTPLE  INTEGRAL.        415
The  reiuaiiiiiig  integrations  will  take  place  between  z  =  z^  and  similar successive  parallel  planes  ;  and,  according  to  tbe  portion  of  the  solid  which any  two  of  these  planes  intercept,  the  limits  of  x  for  that  integral  will  be  one or  other  of  the  bounding  surfaces,  curved  or  plane,  the  limits  of  y,  one  or other  of  the  curved  surfaces.
The  general  problem  to  change  the  variables  in  a  multiple integral,'  and  determine  the  limits  from  the  given  equations, may  now  be  solved.
2778  First,  in  the  case  of  a  double  integral,
/•.r2  /-MS  (j)
F{x,y)(Udy     (m).,
to  change  from  q^,  y  to  S,  v,  having  given  the  equations  u  =  0, v  =  0,  involving  the  four  variables.
To  change  y  for  rj,  eliminate  ^  between  these  equations  ;  thus  y  =f(-v,  v) and  dy  =  /^  {x,  ?/)  dt].    Substituting  these  values,  we  shall  have
F(x,  y)  dy  =  F{xJ(x,  7)  }/„(»•,  v)  dn  =  F,  (x,  n)  dn. Also,  if  T)^  corresponds  to  i/^,  the  equations  y^  =  ^^  (f)   and  y^  =/(«,  Vi)   will give  ?7i  =  4'i  (^')-     Similarly  V2  =  ^2  C^)-
Hence  the  integral  (iii.)  may  now  be  written
F,  (x,  v)  dx  fZ^  =  2  F,  (X,  r,)  dr,  dx     (iv.),
J.riJ>/'i(.r)  JliJ^iC,,)
the  form  on  the  right  being  obtained  by  changing  tJie  order  of  integration,  as explained  in  (2775).
Next,  to  change  x  for  £,  eliminate  y  between  the  equations   «  =  0,  v  =  0  ; thus,  x  =  g{t,,  v)  and  dx  —  g^  (^,  >?)  dt,.     Substituting  as  before,  we  shall  have F,(x,rj)dx  =  F^{t,-n)dl
Also,  ^1  cori'esponding  to  x^,  the  equations  x^  =  "^^  (jj)  and  «i  =  f7  (^d  ^)  W°' duce  ^1  =  m■^  (»?),  and  in  the  same  way  ^3  =  m.^  (n)-     Hence,  finally,
F{x,y)dxdy  =  :z\  F,{^,  ^)  dii  di    (v.)
In  the  last  transformation  from  x  to  ^,  the  most  general  form  of  tho integrals  which  may  be  included  under  S  has  been  chosen.  When  any  of  the limits  of*  are  constants,  the  process  is  simplified.
2779  Again,  to  change  the  variables  from  x,y,z  to  ^,  r?,^, in  the  triple  integral,

416  INTEGBAL  CALCULUS.
First,  to  cliange  from  z  to  C,  eliminate  ^  and  n  between  the  three equations,  and  let  the  resulting  equation  be  z  =/(*,  y,  0-  From  this dz  =  f^(x,  y,  4)  dZ]  therefore
F(x,  y,  z)  dz  =  F{x,  y,f(x,  y,  0}/^ (^.  V,  0  d'C  =  F,{x,  y,  0  dl Also,    if   ^1    corresponds  to  the   limit  z^,    the   equations   z^  =  Xi  (■"> !/)    ^^*^ »i  =/('^  2/'  ^1)    give   Ci  =  <^i  (.e,  2/)-      Similarly    C^  =  ^3(2?,  ?/).
The  integral  (vi.)  may  therefore  be  written
F,(..,y,0fZ.^%c?^  =  2                             F,(x,y,OdCdxdy J .vi  J  M£)  Ui(^-,y)  J^i  J*i(^)  J*i(^,j-)    (vii.),
the  last  form  being  the  result  of  changing  the  order  of  integration,  as  ex- plained in  (2777).  We  have  now  to  change  from  y  to  >) ;  we  therefore eliminate  z  and  ^  from  the  equations  u,  v,  w,  obtaining  an  equation  of  the form  y  =/(f,  x,  j;),  and  proceed  exactly  as  before.  The  result,  as  respects the  general  foi'm  of  integral  in  (vii.),  will  be
F,(x,v,Od^dxdr,    (vm.)
The  order  of  x  and  t)  has  now  to  be  changed  by  (2775).  Since  C  is  a constant  with  respect  to  integrations  for  x  and  ?j,  '^x(0'  ^".(O  "will  also  be constants,  while   \^(ii,x),  XjC'T,  «)   will  be  functions  of  the  single  variable  x.
Suppose  r]  =  \{ii,x)  gives  x  =  A^{i;,r]).  Similarly,  x  =  A^{!i,ri)  maybe the  other  limit.
At  the  point  where  x  =  '^i(i^)  and  ri  =  \(^,x),  we  shall  obtain  by eliminating  «,  say,  v  =  l^i(0-  Similarly,  from  x='^i(Q  and  »?  =  A,, ( (T,  :c) suppose,  we  get  r)  =  fA2(i^)  for  the  next  limit;  then  a  general  form  for  the transformed  integi'al  will  be
r^2  f/^2(^)  rA2(^,r,)
F,(x,r,,Odi:dr,dx   (ix.)
J^Jmi(6")JAi(^,7,)
It  now  remains  to  change  from  the  variable  x  to  ^.  Eliminating  y  and  z between  the  equations  u,  v,  iv,  we  have  a  result  of  the  form  x-=f  {l,  v,  0- Substituting  for  x  and  dx  as  before,  we  arrive  finally  at  the  form
F,{^,V,0<-Udr,d^     (x.)
It  should  be  noticed  that  the  limits  x  =  A^ii',  »;),  x  =  Ao(C,  v),  in  (i^-),  are not  necessarily  different  curves.  They  may,  in  some  of  tlie  partial  integrals, be  different  portions  of  the  same  curve.  This  was  exemplified  in  the  last integral  of  (2770).

EXPANSIONS  OF   FUNCTIONS   IN   CONVERGING SERIES.
The  expansion  of  a  function  by  Maclaurin's  theorem  (1507) can  be  at  once  effected  if  the  ■n}^^  derivative  of  the  function  is known,  or  if  merely  the  value  of  the  same,  when  the  inde- pendent variable  vanishes,  is  known.  Some  ?z*^^  derivatives  of different  functions,  in  addition  to  those  given  at  (1461-71), are  therefore  here  collected.  When  the  general  value  would be  too  complicated,  the  value  for  the  origin  zero  alone is  given.

When  ^  =  1  each  element  of  the  integral  vanishes,  excepting  for  values  of  v which  lie  near  to  x.  Therefore  the  only  appreciable  value  of  the  integral arises  from  such  elements,  and  in  these  z  will  have  values  near  to  zero,  both positive  and  negative,  since  x  has  a  fixed  value  between  I  and  — 1.  Let  these values  of  z  range  from  — /3  to  a.     Then  between  these  small  limits  we  shall

and  the  integral  takes  the  form
when  7;  is  made  equal  to  vmity,  which  establishes  the  formula.
In  the  case,  however,  in  which  x  =  I,  siu"  ^^-   vanishes  at  both  limits,  that
is,  when  z  =  0  and  when  2  =  —  2Z.  We  have  therefore  to  integrate  for  a from  -/5  to  0,  and  also  from  -21  to  —2l  +  n,  a  and  /3  being  any  sra^all quantities.  The  first  integration  gives  Icp  (I)  as  above,  putting  a  =  U.  The second  integration,  by  substituting  y  =  z  +  2l,  produces  a  sin\ilar  form  with limits  0  to  a,  and  with  f  (ji;-2l)  in  the  place  of  (j>  (x)  giving  lij>  (  —  1)  when x  =  l.  Thus  the  total  value  of  the  integral  is  Jf  (l)  +  i<!'  (  — 0-  The  result is  the  same  when  x  =  —  l.
That  the  right  side  of  equation  (i.)  forms  a  converging  series  appears  by integrating  the  general  terms  by  Parts;   thus
^  (.)  eos  —j—^  dv  =  --  )  ^  (.)  s:n  _^—  ^  _^
  0  (v)  sm   ^-   ^  dv,
which  vanishes  when  n  is  infinite,  provided  f  (v)  is  not  infinite.
Hence  the  multiplication  of  such  terms  by  h"  when  )b  is  infinite  produces no  finite  result  when  h  is  made  =  1,  although  1"  is  a  factor  of  indeterminate
value.
2955«  A  function  of  the  form  ({>(:x)  cosnx,  with  %  infinitely great,  has  been  called  ''  a  fluctuating  function,''  for  the  reason that  between  any  two  finite  limits  of  the  variable  x,  the  func- tion changes  sign  infinitely  often,  oscillating  between  the values  (^(03)  and  —<l>(x).  The  preceding  demonstration  shows that  the  sum  of  all  these  values,  as  x  varies  continuously between  the  assis^ned  limits,  is  zero.
By  similar  reasoning,  the    two    following    equations    are obtained. 2956     If  3>  ^^las  any  value  between  0  and  Z,

This  formuk  is  true  for  any  vahie  of  x  between  0  and  /, both  inclusive.
But  if  X  be  >  /,  write  (^  (,/'  ~  2ml)  instead  of  <^{x)  on  the left,  where  %nl  is  that  even  multiple  of  I  which  is  nearest  to  x in  value.

2959  H^v)  =  |2rsm^fsm^>(r)<fo    (5).
This  formula  holds  for  any  value  of  x  between  0  and  I exclusive  of  those  values.
If  X  be  >  I,  write  ■±(\>{x~  2ml)  instead  of  (p{x)  on  the  left, +  or  —  according  as  x  is  >  or  <  2nil,  the  even  multiple  of  I which  is  nearest  to  x  in  value.
But  if  X  be  0  or  /,  or  any  multiple  of  /,  the  left  side  of  this equation  vanishes.
If  the  sign  of  x  be  changed  on  the  right,  the  left  side  is numerically  the  same  in  every  case,  but  of  opposite  sign.
Proof. — For  (2958-9).  To  obtain  (4)  take  the  sum,  and  to  obtain  (5) take  the  difference,  of  cquatJDns  (2)  and  (o).  To  determine  the  values  of the  series  when  x  is  >  /,  put  ,e  =  2ml  =b  '/,  so  that  x'  is  <  Z.

Proof. — In  ascertaining  tlic  valae  of  the  integral  in  the  demonstration of  (2955),  we  are  only  cjiicerned  witli  the  form  of  the  function  cl  ise  to  the value  of  aj  in  question.  Hence  the  result  is  not  affected  by  the  di.^continuity unless  x=a.  In  this  case  the  integration  for  z  is  from  — /3  to  0  with  (p  (x) for  the  function,  and  from  0  to  a  with  4'  G^)  for  the  function,  producing ^<p(a)  +  l^  (a).
2964  Hence    an    expression    involving    x    in    an    infinite
series  of  sines  of  consecutive  multiples  of  --^   may  be  found,
such  that,  when  x  lies  between  any  of  the  assigned  limits (0  and  a,  a  and  h,  b  and  c,  ...  h  and  I),  the  serie3  sh  dl  be  equal respectively  to  the  corresponding  assigned  functions

GAUSS'S   METHOD. 2997     When  f{x)  is  an  integral  algebraic  function  of  degree 2n,  or  lower,  Gauss's  formula  of  approximation  is

The  formula  is  evidently  applicable  to  a  function  of  any form  which  can  be  expanded  in  a  converging  algebraic  series not  having  a  fractional  index  in  the  first  2)i  terms.  The  result will  be  the  approximate  value  of  those  terms.
Proof. — Let        '•P  (■'-')  =  (.i'  —  .-Co)(x—a\)  ...  (.»  — a-,,),
and  let  f  (x)  =  Q-sly(x)  +  B     (viii.),
where /(«)  is  of  the  -211^^  degree,  Q  of  the  n  —  V'\  and  B  of  the  n"\  since  \p{x) is  of  the  71+  I"'  degree.
Then  the  method  consists  in  choosing  a  function  v^  (;)!)  of  the  ?i  + 1"'  degree,
so  that      Q  4^  (x)  dx  shall  vanish  ;   and  a  function  B  of  the  n^^  degree,  which
shall  coincide  with/(.7;)  when  x  is  any  one  of  the  n  +  1  roots  of  i//  {x)  =  0.
(i.)   To  ensure  that      Qi/{x)dx  =  ().     We  have,  by  Parts,  successively,
writing  N  for  i//  {x),  and  with  the  notation  of  (2148),
\xm=x^^\N-,l(^x^-^\N)
=  x^  [  N-pxP-'  [  N+p  (p-l){  l^x^'-'  f   -v)
=  &c.  &c.
=  X''  [  N-px''-'  [  N+p  (p-1)  X''-'  {  N-...zk\ji\    ^^^N         (ix.)
Now  Q\P  (x)  is  made  up  of  terms  like  x^  4>  (x)  with  integral  values  of  jj  from 0  to  n  —  1  inclusive.     Hence,  if  the  value  (vi.)  be  assumed  for  ^(x),  wo

see,  by  (ix.),  that     (2\p  (x)  dx  will  vanish  at  both  limits,  because  the  factors X  and  .X  — 1  will  appear  in  every  term.
(ii.)  Let  It  be  the  function  on  the  right  of  ef|nation  (v.)  Then,  when X  =  Xr,  "we  see,  by  (vii.)*  that  Ay  =  1,  and  that  the  other  coefficients  all  vanish. Hence  R  becomes  /(.r)  whenever  x  is  a  root  of  xp  Oc)  =0.

The  order  of  K  is  twice  that  of  the  highest  derivative  contained  in  V.  Let n  be  the  order  of  K,  then  there  will  be  2n  constants  in  the  solution  of  equa- tion (vi.)  and  the  same  niimber  of  equations  for  determining  them.  For there  are  2)i  terms  in  equation  (vii.)  involving  o?/i,  Bij^,  dp^,  &c.  If  any  of these  quantities  are  arbitrary,  their  coefficients  must  vanish  in  order  that equation  (vii.)  may  hold;  and  if  any  are  not  arbitrary,  they  will  be  fixed  in their  values  by  given  equations  which,  together  with  the  equations  furnished by  the  coefficients  which  have  to  be  equated  to  zero,  will  make  up,  in  all,  2?i equations.
PARTICULAR  CASES.
3033  I- — When  V  does  not  involve  x  explicitly,  a  first integral  of  the  equation  K  =  0  can  always  be  found.  Thus, if,  for  example,
a  first  integral  will  be
+  QP.-Q.P
The  order  of  this  equation  is  less  by  one  than  that  of  (vi.)
Proof.— We  have         V^=Np-\-Pq+  Qr  +  Bs. Substitute  the  value  of  iV  from  (vi.),  and  it  will  be  found  that  each  pair  of terms  involving  P,  Q,  E,  &c.  is  an  exact  differential.
3034  II- — When  V  does  not  involve  y,  a  first  integral  can be  found  at  once,  for  then  N=  0,  and  therefore  K=  0,  and
we  have  -P«— Q2.c+^3a:~~<-^c.  =  0;
and  therefore  P—Q^.-\-Roj.  —  &g.  =  A.
3035  III- — When  V  involves  only  y  and  p,
V=Fp-i-A,         by  Case  I.
3036  IV. — When  V  involves  only  i?  and  q,
V  =  Qq+Ap+B.  See  also  (3046).
Proof.     K  =  —P^+Q2x  =  0,  giving,  by  integration,  P  =  Q^  +  A.
Also  V,  =  Pq+Qr  =  Aq+  Q,q  +  Qr.
Integrating  again,  we  find       V  =  Qq  +  Ap  +  B, a  reduction  from  the  fourth  to  the  second  order  of  differential  equations.

Suppose  «!,  but  not  y^,  is  fixed.  Then  h/^  is  arbitrary  ;  therefore its    coefficient  in  (3)   (P— Qa!+&c.)i  must  vanish;    that  is,    (Vp)^  =  0,    or

3038  Tn  the  example  of  the  brachistochrone,  it  is  useful  to  notice  that — (i.)   If  the  extreme  points  are  fixed,  ^//„,  cy^  both  vanish.
(ii.)  If  the  tangents  at  the  extreme  points  have  fixed  directions,  fj\„  ^Pi hoth  vanish.

Ex.— In  the  brachistochrone  problem  (3037),  the  result  thus  arrived  at signifies  that  the  cycloid  is  at  right  angles  to  each  of  the  given  curves  at  its extremities.
3041  If  V  involves  the  limits  x^,  x^,  y^,  jh,  Ih,  Ih^  &c.,  the terms  to  be  added  to  8?7  in  (3029),  on  account  of  the  varia- tion of  any  of  these  quantities,  are

In  the  last  integral,  g//o,  ^j/i,  ^Jh,  &c.  may  be  placed  outside the  symbol  of  integration  since,  they  are  not  functions  of  x.
Hence,  when  F  involves  the  limits  x^,  x^,  y^,  y^,  i?q,  Px,  &c., and  those  limits  are  variable,  the  complete  expression  for

The  relation  7^=  0  is  unaltered,  and,  by  means  of  it,  the additional  integrals  which  appear  in  the  value  of  H^—B^ become  definite  functions  of  x.

FUNCTIONS   OF  TWO  DEPENDENT  VARIABLES.        449
where  p,  q,  ...  ^  as  before,  are  tlie  successive  derivatives  of  ^,
and  p',  q,  ...  those  of  z.
Then,  if  the  forms  of  the  functions  y,  z  vary,  the  condition
P'  .
for  a  maximum  or  minimum  value  of  ?7  or        Vdx  is
W=  r{KSf/-\-K'B:^)  dj+H,^H,-^H;-H^=0  ...  (2).
Here  K',  H'  involve  z,  }'>'■>  ?'»  •••5  precisely  as  K,  jff  involve y,  p,  q,  ... ;  the  values  of  the  latter  being  given  in  (3029).
3052     First,  if  y  and  ^z  are  independent,  equation  (2)  ne- cessitates the  following  conditions  :
^  =  0,     ^'=0,     H,-H,+H,'-H,'=0   (3).
The  equations  K  =  0,  K'  =  0  give  y  and  z  in  terms  of  a;, and  the  constants  which  appear  in  the  solution  must  be  deter- mined by  equating  to  zero  the  coefficients  of  the  arbitrary
quantities     ^y^,  %i,  ^p^,  Sp^  ...  Szq,  S^i,  ^j)^,  Sjh't  ... »
which  are  found  in  the  equation
H,-H,  +  H,'-H,'=  0     (4).
3053  The  number  of  equations  so  obtained  is  equal  to  the number  of  constants  to  be  determined.
Proof.— Let       V  =  f{x,  y,  y„  y^  ...  i/„^,  z,  z^,  z^  ...  2^^), K  is  of  order  2/t  in  y,  and  .-.  of  form  (p  (a;,  ?/,  y^...  1/2,,^,  «,  Zj,  ...  «(«+„)x)  •••  (i-)i K'  is  of  order  2w  in  z,  and  .'.  of  form  ^  (a*,  y,yt ...  y{m*H)xi  ^t  ^x  •••  ^jibx)  •••  (ii-)
Differentiating  (i.)  2m  times,  and  (ii.)  m  +  n  times,  3wH-n+2  equations  are obtained,  between  which,  if  we  eliminate  z,  jJj.  ...  2(3,„+„)a.,  we  get  a  resulting equation  in  ?/,  of  order  2{m-^n),  whose  solution  will  therefore  contain 2(m  +  n)  arbitrary  constants.  The  equations  for  finding  these  are  also 2  {w,-\-7i)  in  number,  viz.,  2rt  in  H^  —  Hf^  and  'Im  in  H[  —  H'q.
3054  Note. — The  numberof  equations  for  determining  the  constants  is  not generally  affected  by  any  auxiliary  equations  introduced  by  restricting  the limits.  For  every  such  equation  either  removes  a  terra  from  (4)  by  an- nulling some  variation  (cy,  ^p,  &c.),  or  it  makes  two  terms  into  one ;  in  each case  diminishing  by  one  the  number  of  equations,  and  adding  one  equation, namely  itself.
3055  Secondly,  let  y  and  z  be  connected  by  egjiie  equation

(j,  (^xy:c)  =  0.  y  and  z  are  tlieii  found  by  solving  simultane- ously tlie  equations
(j)  {a\  y,z)  =  0        and         K  :  <l>y  =  K'  :  <^^.
Proof — (p  (x,  y,  z)  =  0,  and  therefore  <}>  (x,  y  +  ^y,  z  +  Sz)  =  0,  wten  the forms  of  y  and  z  vary.  Therefore  (p^^y  +  cpJz  =  0  (1514),  Also  K^y  +  K'h  =  0, by  (2).     Hence  the  proportion.
3056  Thirdly,  let  tlie  equation  connecting  7j  and  z  be  of  tlie more  general  form
4>{^^>y>p>q  ...  ^,p',q' ...)  =  0   (5).
By  differentiation,  we  obtain
If  (wliich  rarely  happens)  this  equation  can  be  integrated  so as  to  furnish  a  value  of  ^z  in  terms  of  %,  then  dj)',  dq\  &c. may  be  obtained,  by  simple  differentiation,  in  terms  of  Sz/,  ^_p. Generally,  we  proceed  as  follows  : —
^V=my+P^p-hQh  +  ...+N'h  +  F^P+Q'^q'  +   (7).
Multiply  (6)  by  X,  and  add  it  to  (7),  thus
,„  +  {N'-^\<t>,)^z  +  {P'+Xi>,)^jy  +   (8).
The  expression  for  SZ7  will  therefore  be  the  same  as  in  (2),  if we  replace  iV by  iV+Xe^^,  P  by  P  +  X<^^,  &c.,  thus
3057  BU=:^\{{N+\<l>,)-(P+\ct>X-\-...}Si/

3058  To  render  W  independent  of  the  variation  h,  we  must

3059      Ex.  (i.)— Given   F=  Fix,  7j,p,  q  ...  2),  where
z='\vdx     and    v  =  F(x,y,p,  q  ...).        :^f^
Tlie  equation  f  is  now    z—^vdx  =  0    or    v—Zj.=  0,

<p,  =  0,  (j>p,=  —1,  ^3'=  0,  the  rest  vanishing.
Substituting  these  values  in  (9),  we  obtain

Tor  the  complete  variation  DU  add  V^dx^—VQdxQ.  To  reduce  the  above  so as  to  remove  Sz,  we  must  put  N'  +  K=  0,  and  therefore  \  =— j  N'dx.  Let \  =  M  be  the  solution,  u  being  a  function  of  a;,  y,p,q  ...  »•  Substituting  this expression  for  A,  the  value  of  cU  becomes  independent  of  ^z.
Ex.  (ii.) — Similarly,  if  z  in  the  last  example  be  =  j^^'"   (2148),  (p  becomes v—Zjjj,  =  0;  and,  to  make  N'+\^  vanish,  we  must  put  A  =  —y^^N'.
3061      Ex.  (iii.)— Let   Z7=  f    x/l  +  yl  +  zldx    (1).
Here    N  =  0 ;     N' =  0  ;     P  =  — =^==^  ;     P' =         J---==;     Q=0; Q'=0;  and  the  equations  K—0,  K'—O  become P,  =  0,     P;  =  0,     or
Solving  these  equations,  we  get
y^  =  ?n  ;     z-^  =  n;     or     y  =  mx-\-A  ;     z  =  nx  +  B.
3082      First,  if  x„  y„  z^,  x^,  y^,  z^   be  given,  there  are  four  equations  to determine  m,  n,  A,  and  B.
This  solves  the  problem,  to  find  a  line  of  minimum  length  on  a  given curved  surface  between  two  fixed  points  on  the  surface.
3063       Secondly,  if  the  limits  .Tj,  x^  only  are  given,  then  the  equations
{P\  =  0,      (P)o=0,     (P')i  =  0,      (P')o=0, are  only  equivalent  to  the  two  equations  m  =  0,  n  —  0,  and  A  and  B  remain undetermined.

3070  Proposition  I. — To  find  a  curve  s  which  will  make F  [x,  y)  ds  a  maximum  or  minimum,  F  being  a  given  function
of  the  coordinates  x,  y.
The  equation  (5),  in  (3056),  here  becomes
where  p  =  Xg,  p'  =  y^,   x  and  y  being  the  dependent  variables,  and  s  the  in- dependent variable.
In  (3057),  we  have  now,  writing  u  for  F(x,  y),
N  =  u^,     N'  =  My,     fp  =  2p,     fp,  =  2p'; the  rest  zero.     The  equations  of  condition  are  therefore

Multiplying  by  Xg,  yg  respectively,  adding  and  integrating,  the  result  is
\  =  u, the  constant  being  zero.*
Substituting  this  value  in  equations  (1),  differentiating  tta;^  and  uyg,  and putting  Wj  =  u^Xg  +  u^yg,  we  get

Let  F{x,  7/)  =  n    and   /(x,  y)  =  v.
Equation  (1)  is  equivalent  to     \{u-\-vx^  ds.
In  (3057)  we  now  bave   V=u  +  vp;  and  for  (p,  p'^+p^  =  1,   as  in  (3070). Tberefore  N  =  u^  +pu^  ;         P  =  Vp  =  v;         </)j,  =  2p-,

ON  THE  GENERAL  OBJECT  OF  THE  CALCULUS  OF VARIATIONS.
3084  Definitions. — A  function  whose  form  is  invariable  is called  determinate^  and  one  whose  form  is  variable,  indeter- minate.
Let  du  be  the  increment  of  a  function  u  due  to  a  change in  the  magnitude  of  the  independent  variable,  hi  that  due  to  a change  in  the  form  of  the  function,  Du  the  total  increment from  both  causes ;  then
Dv  =  du-^hL.
Thus,  in  (3042),  the  terms  iavolving  dx^  and  dx^  constitute  du, and  the  remaining  terms  8// ;  the  whole  variation  being  Du. hi  is  called  the  variation  of  the  function  u.
3085  A  primitive  indeterminate  function,  u,  of  any  number of  variables  is  a  function  whose  variation  is  of  arbitrary  but constant  form ;  in  other  words,  ^hi  =  0.

3086  Let  V  =^  F.u  be  a  derived  function, — tliat  is,  a  func- tion derived  by  some  process  from  the  function  u ;  F  denoting a  relation  between  the  forms,  but  not  between  the  magnitudes, of  u  and  v.
The  general  object  of  the  Calculus  of  Variations  is  to determine  the  change  in  a  derived  function  v,  caused  by  a change  in  the  form  of  its  primitive  ?l
The  particular   derived   functions  considered   are    those
whose  symbols  are  d  and  ,  denoting  operations  of  differ- entiation and  integi^ation  respectively.
SUCCESSIVE  VARIATION.
3087  Let  the  variation  of  the  variation,  or  second  variation of  V  due  to  a  change  in  the  form  of  the  involved  function, y  =f(x),  be  denoted  by  S  (§F)  or  ^'F;  the  third  variation  by B^V,  and  so  on.
By  definition  (3085),  y  being  a  primitive  indeterminate function,  and  ^?/ its  variation,  ^-y  =  0    (1).
3088  The  second  variation  of  any  derivative  of  y  is  also zero,  i.e.,  ^"^p,  ^^q,  &c.  all  vanish.
•    Proof.-    P(y„,)  =  B  (c^,,,)  =  {S  (hj)},^  =  (chj)„,  =  0  by  (1).
3089  If  V  =  f{x,  y,  2^,  q,  r,  &c.  ...),  where  ?/  is  a  primitive indeterminate  function  of  x,  then
where,  in  the  formal  expansion  by  the  multinomial  theorem, hj,  ^j),  &c.  follow  the  law  of  involution,  but  the  indices  of  r/^, dp,  &c.  indicate  repetition  of  the  operation  dy,  d^,  &c.  upon  F.
Proof.— First,       ^V=(^yd^  +  dp dp  +  ^d^+...)  V. In   finding  PV,  each  product,   such  as   hj  dyV,   is  differentiated  again  as  a function  of  i/,  f,  q,  &c.  ;  but,  since  the  variations  of  ^?/,  cp,  &c.  vanish  by  (2), it  is  the  same  in  effect  as  tlioiigh  ey,  ^j),  &c.  were  not  operated  upon  at  all. They  accordingly  rank  as  algebraic  quantities  merely,  and  therefore
PV=  (^yd,  +  Spdp  +  ^qd,+  ...yV. Similarly  for  a  third  differentiation  ;  and  so  on.

integrable  whatever  tlie  form  of  the  function  y  may  be,  it  is said  to  be  immediately  integrahle,  or  integrable  per  se.
3091     The   requisite    condition   for    V  to    be    immediately integrable  is  that  K=  ^  shall  be  identically  true.
Peoof. —        Vclx  must  be  expressible  in  tlie  form
■where  (p  is  independent  of  the  form  of  y.     Hence,  a  change  in  the  form  of  y, which  leaves  the  values  at  the  limits  unaltered,  will  leave
I  'Vdx  =  0  ;     that  is,    i  ^K^y  =  0.
But  the  last  equation  necessitates  7v  =  0,  since  cy  is  arbitrary.     And  K=0 must  be  identically  true,  otherwise  it  would  determine  y  as  a  function  of  x.
DIFFERENTIAL    EQUATIONS.
GENERATION  OF  DIFFERENTIAL  EQUATIONS.
3050  By  differentiating  ordinary  algebraic  equations,  and eliminating  constants  or  functions,  differential  equations  are produced.  Some  methods  are  illustrated  in  tlie  following examples.
3051  From  an  equation  between  two  variables  and  n arbitrary  constants,  to  eliminate  the  constants.
Rule. — Differentiate  r  times  (r<n),  and  from  the  r  +  1 equations  any  r  constants  may  he  eliminated,  and  thus  C  (n,  r) different  equations  of  the  r*^  order  (3060)  obtained,  involving
-3-^,  -r — ^,  &c.  Only  r-|-l,  however,  of  these  equations  will  he dx'"    dx''"^
independent.     By  differentiating  n  times  and  eliminating  the
constants,  a  single  final  differential  equation  of  the  n*^  order
free  from  constants  may  he  obtained.
3052  Ex. — To  eliminate  the  constants  a  and  h  from  the  equation
y  =  ax^  +  hx        (i.)
Differentiating,  we  find  -  "^  =  2ax  +  h   (ii.)
Eliminating  a  and  b  in  turn,  we  get
a.  4^  +hx  =  2y,       a:^  =  ax-  +  y      (iii.,  iv.)
dx  ax
Now,  differentiating  (iii.)  and  eliminating  h  produces  the  final  equation  of the  second  order,
^^  ||  -2x^  +2y  =  0   (v.)
The  same  equation  is  obtained  by  differentiating  (iv.)  and  eliminating  a.
3053  To  eliminate  tbe  function  <p  from  tbe  equation  z  =  (p  (r), where  z?  is  a  function  of  x  and  //.     We  have

3054  To  eliminate  </>  from  'ii  =  (p  {v),  where  ti  and  v  are  func- tions of  X,  y,  z.
Consider  x  and  y  the  independent  variables,  and  differ- entiate for  each  separately,  thus
^*x  +  ^^z ^^:c  =  1>'{v)  {I'x  +  ^z ^x) , Uy  +  U,Zy  =  <}>'{v)  {Vy+V,Z^),
and,  by  division,  <{>' (v)  is  eliminated.

F  {x,  y,  z,  «^i(ai),  faW,  ...  i>nM]  =  0, where  a^,  a^,  ...  a^  are  known  functions  of  x,  y,  z.
Rule. — Differentiate  for  x  and  y  as  independent  variahles, forming  the  derivatives  of  ¥  of  each  order ^  up  to  the  (2n  — 1)*^ in  every  possible  ivay ;  that  is,  F;  F^,  ¥y;  Fg^.,  F.^^,  Fj^,;  Sfc. There  will  be  2n^  unhnoivn  functions,  consisting  of  (pi,  (p^,  ...  ^« and  their  derivatives,  and  2n'^  +  n  equations  for  eliminating them.

F [x,y,z,l,  .p,{^),  U^)  ...  <PM]  =  ^^ f{x,y,z,K,i>,(^),<p,i^.)...<p^{'.)\=0.

3057  To  ehminate  ^  from  the  equation
F{x,y,z,w,<p{a,^)}  =  0, where  a,  j3  are  known  functions  of  x,  y,  z,  u\

462  DIFFERENTIAL  EQUATIONS.
DEFINITIONS   AND   RULES.
3058  Ordinary  differential  equations  involve  the  derivatives of  a  single  independent  variable.
3059  Partial  differential  equations  involve  partial  deriva- tives, and  therefore  two  or  more  independent  variables  are concerned.
3060  The  order  of  a  differential  equation  is  the  order  of  the highest  derivative  which  it  contains.
3061  The  degree  of  a  differential  equation  is  the  power  to which  the  highest  derivative  is  raised.
3062  A  Linear  differential  equation  is  one  in  which  the derivatives  are  all  involved  in  the  first  degree.
3063  The  complete  primitive  of  a  differential  equation  is that  equation  between  the  primitive  variables  from  which  the differential  equation  may  be  obtained  by  the  process  of  differ- entiation.
3064  The  general  solution  is  the  name  given  to  the  complete primitive  when  it  has  been  obtained  by  solving  the  given differential  equation.
Thus,  reverting  to  the  example  in  (3051),  equation  (i.)  is  the  complete priviifive  of  (v.)  which  is  obtained  from  (i.)  by  diilerentiation  and  elimination.
The  differential  equation  (v.)  being  given,  the  process  is  reversed. Equations  (iii.)  and  (iv.)  are  called  the  first  integrals  of  (v.),  and  equation (i.)  the  final  integral  or  general  sohifion.
3065  ^  particular  solution,  or  particular  integral^  of  a differential  equation  is  obtained  by  giving  particular  values  to the  arbitrary  constants  in  the  general  solution.
For  the  definition  of  a  singular  solution,  see  (3068).
3036  To  find  when  two  differential  equations  of  the  first oi'dor  have  a  common  primitive.
Rule. —  ViffrrentiatG  each  rguatioii,  and  eliminate  its arbitrary  constant.  The  tivo  results  will  agree  if  there  is  a common  primitive jivhichy  in  thai  case,  will  be  found  by  elimi- nating y,  between  the  given  equations.
Ex, — Apply  the  rule  to  equations  (iii.)  and  (iv.)  in  (3052).
SINGULAR  SOLUTIONS.  463
3067     To  find  when  two  solutions  of  a  differential  equation, each,  involving  an  arbitrary  constant,  are  equivalent.
Rule. — Eliminate  07ie  of  the  variables.  The  other  will  also disappear,  and  a  relation  betiveen  the  arbitrary  constants  ivill remain.
Otherwise,  if  V=G,  v  =  c  he  the  two  solutions  :  Fand  v being  functions  of  the  variables,  and  G  and  c  constants ;  then
dV   dv__dV    du_ cLv    dy        dy     d.v
is  the  required  condition.
Proof. —  V  must  be  a  function  of  v.  Let  V=  (p(v);  therefore  Fj  =  ^^v^ and  Fj,=  'pv'^'y't  then  eliminate  <p„.
Ex. — tan"'  (aj  +  7/)  +tan"'  {x  —  y)  =  a  and  x^-\-2hx-  =  2/^  +  1  are  both  solu- tions of  2xyy^  =■  x^  +  y^  +  ^'  Eliminating  y,  x  disappears,  and  the  resulting equation  is  h  tan  a.  =  1 .
SINGULAR   SOLUTIONS.
3068  Definition.  —  "A  singular  solution  of  a  differential equation  is  a  relation  between  x  and  y  which  satisfies  the equation  by  means  of  the  values  which  it  gives  to  the  differ- ential coefficients  t/.^,  y.^j.,  &c.,  but  is  not  included  in  the  com- plete primitive."     See  examples  (3132-3).
3069  To  find  a  singular  solution  from  the  complete  primitive
^{x,y,c)  =  0.
Rule  I. — From  the  complete  primitive  determine  c  as  a function  ofx,  by  solving  the  equation  j^  =  0,  or  else  by  solving Xc  =  0,  and  substitute  this  value  of  c  in  the  ptrimitive.  The result  is  a  singular  solution,  unless  it  can  also  be  obtained  by giving  to  c  a  constant  value  in  the  primitive.
3070  If  the  singular  solution  hivolves  j  only,  it  results  from the  equation  jc=0  only,  and  if  it  involves  x  only,  it  results from  Xc  =  0  only.  If  it  involves  both  x  and  y,  the  two  equa- tions Xc  =  0,  yc  =  0  give  the  rame  result,

Proof. — Let  <p  (x,  y,  c)  =  0   be  expressed  in  the  form

Then,  if  c  be  constant,  yx=fx         (2);
and,  if  c  varies,  yx=fx+fcCx       (3)-
When  c  is  constant,  the  differential  equation  of  which  (1)  is  the  primitive  is satisfied  by  the  vahie  of  ?/^  in  (2).  But  it  will  also  be  satisfied  b}'  the  same value  of  y^  when  c  is  variable,  provided  that  either  fc  =  0  or  /^  =  co ,  and  in either  case  a  solution  is  obtained  which  is  not  the  result  of  giving  to  c  a constant  value  in  the  complete  primitive;  that  is,  it  is  a  singular  solution. But  f^  =  0  is  equivalent  to  y^  =  0,  and  /j.  =  oo  makes  y^  =  (Xi ,  and  therefore X  =  constant.
GEOMETRICAL  MEANING  OP  A  SINGULAR  SOLUTION.
3072  Since  tlie  process  in  Rule  I.  is  identical  with  that employed  in  finding  the  envelope  of  the  series  of  curves obtained  by  varying  the  parameter  c  in  the  equation (j)  (x,  y,  c)  -—  0 ;  the  singular  solution  so  obtained  is  the  equa- tion of  the  envelope  itself.
An  exception  occurs  when  the  envelope  coincides  with  one of  the  curves  of  the  system.
3073  Ex. — Let  the  complete  primitive  be
w  =  ca;+ v^l— c",     therefore   yc  =  x    ;     yc=^^    gives   c  =  — -
Substituting  this  in  the  primitive  gives  y  =  vl  +  x"^,  a  singular  solution.  P is  the  equation  of  the  envelope  of  all  the  lines  that  are  obtained  by  varying the  parameter  c  in  the  primitive;  for  it  is  the  equation  of  a  circle,  and  the pinmitive,  by  varying  c,  represents  all  lines  which  touch  the  circle.  See  also (3132-3).
3074  "The  determination  of  c  as  a  function  of  aj  by  the  solution  of  the equation  y^  =  0,  is  equivalent  to  determining  what  particular  primitive  has contact  with  the  envelop  at  that  point  of  the  latter  which  cori-esponds  to  a given  value  of  x.
"The  elimination  of  c  between  a  primitive  y=f(x,c)  and  the  derived equation  y^  =  0,  docs  not  necessarily  lead  to  a  singular  solution  in  the  sense above  explained.
"  Por  it  is  possible  that  the  derived  equation  ?/p  =  0  may  neither,  on  the one  hand,  enable  us  to  determine  c  as  a  function  of  x,  so  leading  to  a  singular solution  ;  nor,  on  the  other  hand,  as  an  absolute  constant,  so  leading  to  a particular  primitive.
SINGULAR  SOLUTIONS.  465
"  Thus  the  particular  pi-imitive  y  =  e"  being  given,  the  condition  yc=  0 gives  e"^  =  0,  whence  c  is  +co  if  a;  be  negative,  and  — oo  if  «  be  positive. It  is  a  dependent  constant.  The  resulting  solution  J/  =  0  does  not  then represent  an  envelope  of  the  curves  of  particular  primitives,  nor  strictly  one of  those  curves.  It  repi^esents  a  curve  formed  of  branches  from  two  of  them. It  is  most  fitly  chai^acterised  as  a  particular  primitive  marked  by  a  singularity in  the  mode  of  its  derivation  from  the  complete  primitive."

DETERMINATION  OF  A  SINGULAR  SOLUTION  FROM  THE DIFFERENTIAL  EQUATION.
3075  Rule  II, — Any  relation  is  a  singular  solution  luhich, ivhile  it  satisfies  the  differential  equation,  either  involves  j  and
makes  Py  iifinite,  or  involves  x  aiid  makes  (  —  \  infinite.
3076  "  One  negative  feature  marks  all  the  cases  in  which  a  solution involving  y  satisfies  the  condition  p^  =  ao  .  It  is,  that  the  solution,  while expressed  by  a  single  equation,  is  not  connected  with  the  complete  primitive by  a  single  and  absolutely  constant  value  of  c.
"  The  relation  which  makes  p,,  infinite  satisfies  the  differential  equation only  because  it  satisfies  the  condition  ?/c  =  0,  and  this  implies  a  connexion between  c  and  x,  which  is  the  ground  of  a  real,  though  it  may  be  unimportant, singularity  in  the  solution  itself.
"  In  the  first,  or,  as  it  might  be  termed,  the  envelope  species  of  singular solutions,  c  receives  an  infinite  number  of  different  values  connected  with  the value  of  a;  by  a  law.  In  the  second,  it  receives  a  finite  nnmber  of  values  also connected  with  the  values  of  x  by  a  law.

Similarly,  when  y  =f(p),   eliminate  dy,  &c.
3225  Ex.— Given    x  =  ay.,  +  hy'i,       i.e.,  x  =  ap  +  hf   (1),
dx  =  adp-\-  2hp  dp,         therefore     dy  =  p  dx  =  apdp  +  2hp-dp,
therefore  !/  =    o   ^ — ^   r  ^  •
Eliminating  jfj  between  this  equation  and  (l),the  result  is  the  complete  primitive (ax  +  6hy  -  hcf  =  (6a7/  - 4i'" -  ac)  (a'  +  -ihx) .

Eliminate  -p  from  the  original  equation  hy  means  of  (I),  and again  hy  means  o/(2).  The  first  elimination  gives  y  =  cx-f-f  (c), the  complete  primitive.     The  second  gives  a  singular  solution.
Proof. — For,  if  Rule  I.  (3169)  be  applied  to  the  primitive  y  =  ex  +f  (c), we  have  x+f{c)  =  0;  and  to  eliminate  c  between  these  equations  is  the elimination  directed  above,  c  being  merely  written  for  p  in  the  two  equations.

Proof.— Differentiate  (6)  on  the  hypothesis  that  A,  B,  Gy&a.  are  func- tions of  X  ;  thus
;y,=  (^a,  +  i?/3,+  ...)  +  (^.a  +  B,/3+...).
Now,  in  addition  to  equation  (1),  n  —  1  relations  may  be  assumed  between the  n  arbitrary  parameters.  Equate  then  the  last  term  in  brackets  to  zero, and  differentiate  y,  in  all,  n  —  1  times,  equating  to  zero  the  second  part  of each  differentiation ;  thus  we  obtain
y^        =Aa^       +BI3^        +&C.     and     Aj,a         +B^l3         -j-&c.  =  0, y,^        =Aa,^       +B(3,^       +&C.     and     A^a^        +B,ft^        +&c.  =  0,

The  n  quantities  A^.,  B^.,  &c.  are  now  determined  by  the  n  —  1  equations  on the  right  and  equation  (1).     For,  differentiating  the  value  of  ^(,j.i)xj  we  have
y,^  =  {Aa„^  +  B(3„^  +  &C.}  +  {^^a(,_i)x  +  5^/3(„_i)..  +  &c.},
and  if  these  values  of  ^^,  y>x,  ...  y,ix  be  substituted  in  (1),  it  reduces  to
^x«(»-l)x  +  -B,.A»-lia-+&C.  =  Q,
for  the  other  part  vanishes  by  the  hypothetical  equation
ynx+(hyin-i)x+---+ci>iy  =  o,
since  the  values  of  y^,  ...  y(H-i)x,  and  the  first  part  of  y^x:  are  the  true  values in  this  equation.
3245  Case  11. — Second  ifef/iot?.— Differentiate  and  eliminate Q.  The  resulting  equation  can  be  solved  as  in  Case  I.  Being of  a  higher  order,  there  will  be  additional  constants  which may  be  ehminated  by  substituting  the  result  in  the  given equation.
3246  Ex.— Given  y,,-7y.  +  V2y  =:^  x     (1).
1st  Method.— Pxxiimg  x  =  0,  the  auxiliary  equation  is  m^—7m  +  12  =  0; therefore  m  =  3  and  4.     Hence  the  complete  primitive  o{tju—7y^+12y  =  0
is  y  =  Ae'''+Be"'   (2).
The  corrected  values  of  A  and  B  for  the  primitive  of  equation  (1)  are  found from

Substituting  these  values  of  ^  and  B  in  (2),  we  find  for  its  complete  primi- tive  y  =  ae\+le    + -J^-
3247  2nd  Method.  y,,-7y.+  12y  =  x     (1).

Differentiating  to  eliminate  the  term  on  the  I'iglit,  we  get
The  aux.  equation  is     m'^—7m^  +  l2m^  =  0 ;     therefore     m  =  4,  3,  0,  0,
Therefore  y  =  Ae'^'  +  Be'^+Cx  +  D   (2)  ;
7/,  =  4>Ae"'  +  dBe''+G',      y,.  =  16^e^  +  95e^
1  7
Substitute  these  values  in  (1)  ;  thus  C  =  —;  D  =  y— r ;
therefore,  substituting  in  (2),  y  =  Ae'^  +  Be^+  ^  +  ^44^^  before.
3248  When  a  particular  integral  of  the  linear  equation (3238)  is  known  in  the  form  ij  =f{x),  the  complete  primitive may  be  obtained  by  adding  to  y  that  value  which  it  would take  if  Q  were  zero.
7 Thus,  in  Ex.  (3247),    2/  =  ?i^  +  TT7  ^^  a  particular  integral  of  (1)  ;  and
iZ        144; the  complementary  part  Ae^'^  +  Be^''  is  the  value  of  y  when  the  dexter  is  zero.
3249  The  order  of  the  linear  equation  (3238)  may  always be  depressed  by  unity  if  a  particular  integral  of  the  same equation,  when  Q  =  0,  be  known.

the  unwritten  terms  containing  i\,  v^x,  and  v^,-.
The  coefficient  of  v  vanishes,  by  hypothesis  ;  therefore,  if  we  put  v^  =  u, we  have  an  equation  of  the  second  order  for  determining  w.     it  being  found,
V  =  yudx-\-G.

3263  When  the  original  equation  is  of  the  2nd  order,  the transformed  equation  in  u  and  z  may  be  obtained  at  once  by changing  a\  y,  ?/.,.,  y.,^  into  1,  z,  if+^j  u-\-uUg,  respectively. The  solution  is  then  completed,  as  in  example  (3264).

The  dimensions  of  x,  ij,  y^,  &c.  with  respect  to  e^  are  1,  1,  0,  —1,  —2,  &c. Therefore  the  same  power  of  e'  will  occur  in  every  term  of  the  liomogeneous equation.
3264  Ex.:  x'y,,=  {y-xy,)\
Making  the  above  substitutions  for  x,  y,  y^,  and  1/2^.,  the  equation  becomes

therefore  t?ar^u=a—z  (1935),       therefore    z^  =  «  =  tan  (a— 2), therefore  dd  =  cot  (a— z)  dz,      therefore  0  =  — log  &  sin  (a  — 2)  (1941). But  6  =  log  X     and     z  = -^,

With  the  view  of  applying  (3265),  the  assumed   dimensions   of  each member  of  this  equation,  being  equated,  give
n—2  +  n—l  =  l-\-n,         therefore   n  =■  4. Thus     x=:e';     y  =  ze''',     y^  =  e'' {z,  +  4^z);     y,,=  e'' {z,,  +  '?z,  +  l'lz). Substituting  in  (1),  e  disappears  ;  and  by  putting  z,  =  u,  z.,  =  uu„  the  equa- tion is  reduced  to

Then —fiPcIx  =  ijQdi/  +  fiIlc1z,  and,  by  (3187),  for  an  exact  differential,  we  must have  (i^Q)~  =  (At-R)v  Write  this  symmetrically  for  P,  Q,  and  B,  differentiate out,  and  add  the  three  equations  after  multiplying  them  respectively  by  P, Q,  and  B.
To  find  the  single  complete  primitive  of  equation  (1),
3322  Rule. — Consider  one  of  the  variables  z  constant,  and therefore  dz  =  0.  Integrate,  and  add  (j>  (z)  for  the  constant  of integration.  Then  differentiate  for  x,  y,  and  z,  and  compare with  the  given  equation  (1).  If  a  primitive  exists,  ^(z)  will  be determined  in  terms  of  z  only  by  means  of  preceding  equations.
The  complete  primitive  so  obtained  is  the  equation  of  a system  of  surfaces,  all  of  the  same  species,  varying  in  position according  to  the  value  assigned  to  the  arbitrary  constant.
3323  Ex.:    (x-Sy-z)dx  +  (2y-dx)dy  +  (z-x)dz  =  0    (1).
Condition  (3321)  is  satisfied  ;  therefore,  putting  dz  =  0,  we  have
(x -Sy-z)  dx  +  (2 // - 3.1')  dy  =  0. Applying  (3187),  M,,  =  —  3  =  iV„  and  integration  gives

(x-Sy- z)  dx  +(2y-  Sx)  dy  +  { f  (,v)  - x }  dz  =  0. Equating    coefficients    with    (1),    f'(z)=z,     therefore    (f>(z)  =  ^z-+C. Hence  the  single  complete  primitive  is

REDUCTION  OF  ORDER  IN  SIMULTANEOUS  EQUATIONS.
3350  TiiEOKEM. — n  simultaneous  equations  of  any  orders between  n  dependent  variables  and  1  independent  variable  are reducible  to  a  system  of  equations  of  the  first  order  by  sub- stituting a  new  variable  for  every  derivative  except  the highest.
3351  The  number  of  equations  and  dependent  variables  in the  transformed  system  will  be  equal  to  the  sum  of  the  indices of  order  of  the  highest  derivatives.  This  will,  therefore,  in general  be  the  number  of  constants  introduced  in  integrating those  equations.  If,  after  integrating,  all  the  new  variables be  eliminated,  there  will  remain  n  equations  in  the  original variables  and  the  above-named  constants.  These  equations form  the  complete  solution.
In  practice,  such  reduction  is  unnecessary.     The  following are  methods  frequently  adopted. : —
3352  Rule  I. — Differentiate  until  by  elimination  of  a  vari- able  and  its  derivatives  an  equation  of  a  higher  order  in  one dependent  variable  only  is  obtained.
3353  Rule  II. — Employ  indeterminate  multipliers.
3354  Ex.  (1):  Xit  =  ax  +  by,     y2t=  a'x  +  b'y.
By  Rule  I.,  differentiating  twice  for  t  and  eliminating  y  and  y.,t,  we  obtain ■^'4i:~ (^  +  &')  *2!;+  {ah'  — ah)  x  =  0, which  may  be  solved  by  (3239).
Otherwise  by  Rule  II.,  exactly  as  in  (3344),  we  find am"  +  (a  —  h')m—h  =  0, and  for  the  exact  differential
(_x-\-iny).^t  =  (a  +  ma)  (x-\-viy), the  solution  of  which,  by  (3239),  is

Equations  (1)  and  (2)  are  the  result  of  eliminating  »i  from  (4).  These two  equations  with  dz  =  pdx  +  qdy  suffice  to  determine  a  first  integral  of (3428)  when  it  exists  in  the  form  «  =/(i),
3432  Ex.(i.):  q{l+q)r-{p  +  q-^2pq)s^p{l-]-p)t  =  0.
Solving  the  quadratic  equation  (1),  we  hud
2nlx  +  qdy  =  0,     or     (1+2^)  dx  + (l  +  q)  dij  =  i)    (5).
First,  dz  =  x>dx-\-qdy  =  0,         .•.     z  =  A.
Monge's  equation  (2)  is     2  (l  +  s)  dpdy+jp  (l+p)  dqdx  =  0,
which,   by   pdx  =  —qdii,    gives   -^£- = --^ ;  and,  integrating,   ——L—B. Hence  a  first  integral  is  — '-  =  (p{z)   (6).
Next,  taking  the  second  equation  of  (5)  with
dz  =  p dx  +  q dy,       dx  +  dy  +  dz  =  0,       .-.  x  +  y  +  z  =  C. Also,  by  (5),  equation  (2)  now  reduces  to   qdj)  =  pdq,   and  by  integration, p  =  qD  ;  therefore  the  other  first  integral  is  p  =  qyp  {x+y  +  z).
For  the  final  integral  integrate  j;  —  ^^'  =  0;   i.e.,  z^~\pz,,  =  0,  by  (3383)  ;

(i.)  Here,  in  (3428),  E  =  1,  S  =  0,  T=-a\  F=0;  therefore  (1) and  (2)  become        dij^—a^dx-  =  0,     dpdy  —  ahJqdx  =  0.
From  (1)  dy  +  adx  =  0,  giving  y  +  ax  =  c,  and  converting  (2)  into dp  +  adq  =  0,  which  gives  p+aq  =  c  ;  therefore  a  first  integral  is

Similarly,  from  (1),  dy  —  adx  =  0  gives  rise  to  another  first  integral

Let  »!  =  a,  L\  =  b,  and  ^i.,  =  a',  r.y  =  b'  be  respectively the  solutions  of  the  two  systems  of  ordinary  differential equations.
3436  Vdp  =  riuthj-  Tih  ^  ITdp  =  m,dij-Tdx  ^ Udq  =  mJx-Bdi/      (3),         Udq  =  m,dx  -Edy  [  (4).

Then  the  first  integrals  of  (1)  will  be
To  obtain  a  second  integral :
3437  1st. — When  m^,  m.^^  are  unequal,  assign  any  particular forms  to  /i  and  /,,  then  substitute  the  values  of  p  and  q,  found from  these  equations  in  terms  of  x  and  y,  in  dz  =  pdx-\-qdy, which  integrate.  Otherwise,  assign  the  form  of  one  only  of the  functions  f\,  f.i,  involving  an  arbitrary  constant  C,  solve for  jj  and  q,  and  integrate  dz  =pdx-\-qdy,  adding  an  arbitrary function  of  C  for  the  constant  of  integration.
3438  2nclly. — When  ')%,  m.2,  are  equal,  and  therefore,  by  (2),
S-'  =  4.{BT^-JJV)     (5).
Equations  (o)  and  (4)  coincide,  and,  since  m  =  ^S, reduce  to
3439  mp=iSdy-Tdx   (6),
Udq  =  iSdx-Bdy   (7),
dz  =    p  dx-\-  qdy   (8) .
Here  py  =  7.,.,  and  therefore  the  last  equation  is  integrable if  the  values  oi  p  and  q,  obtained  by  integrating  (6)  and  (7), be  substituted  in  it.     Let  n  =  a,  v  =  b  be  the  integrals  of  (6)
and  (7) ;  and  let         z  =  (}>  {x,  //,  a,  b,  r)      (0)
be  the  integral  obtained  from  (8).
The  general  integral  is  found  by  making  the  parameters (/,  b,  c  vary  subject  to  tAVO  conditions  b  =  f{a),  c  =  F  (a) ; that  is,  by  differentiating
z  =  <l>{x,y,a,f{<i),  F(n)} for  (i,  and  oHmhiatino'  ti.
3440     The  general  integral  therefore  represents  the  envelope uf  the  surface  whose  equation  is  (l>).
SECOND  ORDER  P.  D.  EQUATIONS.  513
Proof. — (Boole,  Sup.,  p.  147.)  Assuming  a  Isfc  integral  of  the  form u  =f(v),  eliminate  /j,  and  v  from  equations  (o426)  by  multiplying  (i.)  by (H,J?f^,  (ii.)  by  («„)«,„  (iv.)  by  (».r)0'v/)>  (/Ob'^^'vz,  andadding.  Again, eliminate  /x  and  v  by  multiplying  (i.)  by  («.,,)">  (ii-)  by  («v)^  (iii.)  by  (Ux)(Sh)i (v.)  by  (^iij.)  7ip  +  (Uy)  Uq,  and  adding.     The  two  resulting  equations  are
B  (u,)  H,  +  T  («,)  u,  -  U  (u,)  («,,)  +  Vu,,  n,^  =  0  I
E,(n,y+soQM  +  TOhy+v{(n,r)  »,+k)«j  =  o)  
Multiply  the  2nd  of  these  by  m,  divide  by  V,  and  add  to  the  1st  equation  ; the  result  is  expressible  in  two  factors  either  as  (11)  or  (12),
{BOtd  +  ^^hM  +  V<h,}{'>^hM+TOh,)  +  Vu,^}  =  0    (11),
{B(u.)+vi,(u,)  +  J%}{m,M  +  TM  +  ru,}  =  0    (12),
m,,  vi.,  being  the  roots  of  the  quadratic  (2).  By  equating  to  zero  one  factor of  (11)  and  one  of  (12),  we  have  four  systems  of  two  linear  1st  order  P.  D. equations.     Taking  each  system  in  turn  with  the  equations
(ti^)+stip  +  tUq  =  0,
and  eliminating  (uj),  (u^),  u^,  u,^,  we  have  the  de- terminant annexed  for  the  case  in  which  the  1st factor  of  (11)  and  the  2nd  of  (12)  are  equated  to zero.  In  this  case,  and  also  when  the  2nd  factor of  (11)  and  the  1st  of  (12)  are  chosen,  trans- posing mj,  Wj  in  the  determinant,  the  eliminant  is  equivalent  to

having  regard  to  the  values  of  m^vio  and   m-^  +  m.^  from  (2).
When  the  1st  factor  of  both  (11)  and  (12)  is  taken,  the  2nd  order  P.  D. equation  produced  by  the  elimination  is
Vt-B(rt-s')  =  0,
and  when  the  2nd  factor  of  each  is  taken,  the  elimination  produces
rr-T(:rt-s')  =0.
Hence  the  hypothesis  of  a  1st  integral  of  (1),  of  the  form  n  =f(v), involves  the  satisfying  one  or  other  of  the  systems  of  two  simultaneous  equa- tions, (13)  or  (14),  below  :
Now  multiply  the  2nd  equation  of  (13)  by  \  and  add  it  to  the  1st. In  the  result,  collect  the  coefficients  of  lo^,  Uy,  Up,  u^,  u..  The  Lagrangean system  of  auxiliary  equations  (3387)  will  then  be  found  to  be

Eliminating  X,  equations  (3)  are  produced.  Treating  equations  (14)  in the  same  way,  equations  (4)  are  produced.

Rule. — Assume  q  =  ^  (p)  and  express  s  and  t  in  terms  ofq^ and  r;  thuSi  rt  — s"^  vanishes,  and  the  left  side  becomes  a  func- tion 0/  p,  q,  and  qp.
Solve  for  a  Isf  integral  in  terms  o/p  and  q,  and  integrate again  for  the  final  solution.
Proof.—       s  =  5,  =  q^p^  =  (/,,  r ;     f  =  q,  =  q.rpy  =  qlr\ therefore    rt  —  s-  =  0.     Also   P   is    of  the   form     (r,  s,  f)'"  =  r"' (1,  q^,,  cj],)'". Hence  the  equation  takes  the  form    (1,  g^,  ql)'"'  =  0.

SYMBOLIC  METHODS.  521
3516     The  solution  of  the  equation  (:^)238),  viz.,
where  Q  is  a  function  of  x,  is  most  readily  obtained  by  the symbolic  method.  Thus  7%,  7iu,  ...  m,,  being  the  roots  of  the auxiliary  equation  in  (3239),  and  A,B,G  .,.

and  the  whole  operation  upon  zero  produces,  by  (3472),  for the  complementary  term, 3518  (7,e'""'-+a,e'"^''-...  +C,e'v.
Proof. — Equation  (1)  may  be  written
or  (4-w^i)  (d^—ini)  ...  {dx-mn)  y  =  Q,
.-.  by  (3515),     y  =  \(d,-ind(d,-m,)  ...  id,-m,)\-' (Q+0),
whicb,  by  partial  fractions,  is  converted  into  the  formula  above.
If  r  of  the  roots  m^,  m,,  ...  are  each  =.-  ni,  those  roots  give rise  in  (3517)  to  a  single  term  of  the  form

Multiply  the  equation  by  Qf ;  then  the  1st  term  on  the  left becomes,  by  (3489),

Similarly  (x  +  2x')  2,  +  2  (1  +  2.v)  z  =  5x\
Solve  these  by  (3210),  and  substitute  in  m  =  3y  —  2z.

However,  by  first  employing  Proposition  III., the  given  equation  may  frequently  be  so  prepared  that  the final  operation  with  Prop.  IV.  shall  l^e  differentiation  only. See  example  (1).

3585  To  reduce  an  equation  of  the  homogeneous  class (3531)  to  a  binomial  equation  of  the  same  order  of  the  form
The  general  theory  of  such  solutions  is  as  follows.     Let the  given  equation  be
it+q  {(i>+«i)(i>  +  «2)  ...  {D+a,)}-\^'Ui  =  U  ...  (1), %,  rtg,  ...  ctn  being  in  descending  order  of  magnitude.  Putting w  =r  e'^'^v,  by  Prop.  III.,
'V  +  q{D{D-7i:;^,)  ...  (Z>-^^7=^J}-^^«^•  =  e"^'U...  (2).
To  transform  these  factors,  regarded  as  ^  (D),  by  Prop.  IV. into  ■^{D)=D{D  —  l)...{D-n  +  l),  we  convert  D  into  D  +  rn (3582),  r  being  an  integer.
Hence  for  the  j/^^  factor  we  must  have
D-\-rn  —  ai-{-aj,  =  D— j;  +  1,
3586  and  therefore  a^  —  iip  =  rn -\-p  —  1        (3) .
If  this  relation  holds  for  each  of  the  constants  a^  ...  rt„,
equation  (1)  is  reducible  to  the  form

and  the  solution  is  obtained  by  differentiation  only,  performed  on  the  value of  2/  as  obtained  by  the  solution  of  (3),  that  equation  being  equivalent  to D(D-l)(D-2)y  +  -Be''y  =  0,    or,  by  (3489),    y,,  +  Sy  =  0.

Proof.—/"'  (D)  now  contains  a  term  of  the  form

Expand  each  function  F  by  Taylor's  theorem  in  powers  of  D,  operate  upon  v, and  arrange  the  result  according  to  powers  of  0.
In  practice,  proceed  as  in  the  following  example.
3616     Ex.  :  a;u2;,-{-u^+cf^u  =  0.
Multiplying  by  z  and  changing  by  (3489),  this  becomes DV  +  s'e'" u  =  0.     I>-u  =  0   gives  u  =  A  +  Bd.
Substitute  this  value  and  operate  with  I),  considering  A  and  B  as  variables,
and  equate  to  zero  the  coefficients  of  the  powers  of  0  ;  thus B'A  +  q'e^'A  +  WB  =  0,     B'B  +  q'e'^B  =  0.
Then  change  D  into  m,  and  e'^J.  into  a„_r,  to  obtain  the  relations m^a„,-^q^a^.i+2'mb^  =  0 ;     m''b„+ q^b^.^  =  0,

SOLUTION  BY  DEFINITE  INTEGRALS.
3617     La2)lace^s  method. — The  solution  of  the  equation

is  u=C^{e'''^S'^'\cf>t)-'}dt     (2),

Proof.— Assume  t*  =  e    e'^Tdf,  and  substitute  in  (1),  putting  f  (cZ,)  c'' =  ^(0e^'  (3474),  thus
{xe^'f  (0  Tdt+  [  c"xP  (0  Tdt  =  0.

Integrating  the  first  term  by  parts,  this  becomes
e'^cp  (0  r- je-'  [cZ,  [<|>(t)T}-^p  (t)  T^t^O     (4),
an  equation  which  is  satisfied  by  equating  each  term  to  zero.  The  second term  thus  produces  a  value  of  T  by  integration  by  (3209),  and  this  value substituted  in  the  first  term,  and  in  the  value  of  u,  g-ives  the  results  (3) and  (2).
3618  Ex.  (1):        a^u,:,+au^'-q\vu=0*    (4).
Here   <}>  (4)  =  c^a,— j^  ;//  (d^)  -  ad^,  <p  (t)  =  f^-q",  ;//  (0  =  at.     Hence (2)  and  (8)  become
u  =  G{e''(f-q')^''dt;     e''' (t' -  q')^  =  0; a  being  positive,  the  limits  are  t  =  Joq,  and,  putting  t  =  qcos d,   we  find
u=z  C  I  V"'^sin"-'etZ0    (5).
3619  The  solution  in  series  by  (3608)  is  as  follows.  Equations  (1)  and (2)  of  that  article  are  in  this  case
D(D  +  a— 1)m— gV^M  =  0     and    m  (m  +  a  —  l)vn—q^Vn-2  =  0.
Thus,  a  in  (3608)  =0,  and  I  =  1-a.     Therefore  (3610)  becomes
"  =  ^{^+2^)  +  2.4(a  +  li(a  +  3)+^^-
^^-^-1^+2|g^  +  2.4(3-ai(5-.)-^^-}   ^'^'
Both  series  are  convergent  by  (239  ii.).
The  results  deduced  by  Boole  are  these —
3620  (5)  is  equivalent  to  the  particular  integral  represented  by  the  first series  of  (6).
3621  A  second  particular  integral,  by  assuming  u  =  e'^'^'^t;,  is  found  to be,  when  2  — a  is  positive,
u  =  C^x'-"  I  e'^^'^sin'-^flcZfl     (7).

3622  When  a  lies  between  0  and  2,  the  complete  integral  is
tt=  (7ijV^«"'«sin"-^0(Z9+C2a;^"'[V*'='"«sin^-"^(^6l     (8).
*  The  method  by  definite  integrals  is  elucidated  by  Boole  chiefly  in  the  solution  of  this important  equation.

3623  But,  if  a  =  l,  the  solution  becomes
u=  fV*'°««  {A  +  Blog(xsm''d)]  dO     (9).
3624  If  a  does  not  lie  between  0  and  2,  tlieu,  if  a  be  negative,  put a  =  a—2n,  and  replace  the  fix'st  term  of  (8)  by
(7,  (xd,  +  a-l)(ixd,  +  a-S)  ...  (xd,  +  a-27i  +  l)  [V"^^sin<^'-ic^0  ...  (10),
the  transformation  being  eflFected  by  (3580).
3625  And  if  a  be  positive  and  >  2,  put  u  =  e^'^-''''''v  =  x'^'''v.  This  con- verts a  into  2— a,  a  negative  quantity,  and  the  case  is  reduced  to  the  last one.
3626  Ex.  (2). — To  solve  by  tliis  metliod  tlie  P.  D.  equation
ihx+i(2y  +  U2z=  0   (1)

Eliminating  x  and  y,  (1)  becomes
rU2r  +  l('r  +  '>'^''2z  =  0       (2).
Now  the  solution  of  this  equation  is  number  (9)  of  Example  (1),  if  w^e change  x  into  r,  q  into  id^,  and  A  and  B  into  arbitrary  functions  of  z.  We thus  obtain
n=  [V<=°^^^'^={./)(2)  +  ;//(2)log(rsiu=e)}  dd    (3),
or,  by  (3492),
M=     ^j  j^  +  tVcoseJ  fZ9+     ;p(2  4-tVcos0)  log(rBin-^)  c?^   (4).

3627  If  «  be  the  potential  of  an  attracting  mass  at  an  external  point, and  if  it,  =  F  {z)   when  r  =  0  ;  then,  since   log  r  =  oo  ,   ^  (z)  must  vanish  ;
therefore  F(c)  =      <\,  (s)  dd  =  tt^  (z).

4001  In  tliis  system  (Fig.  1)*  the  position  of  a  point  P  in  a plane  is  determined  by  its  distances  from  two  fixed  straight lines  OX,  OY,  called  axes  of  coordinates.  These  distances are  measnred  parallel  to  the  axes.  They  are  the  abscissa  PM or  ON  denoted  by  x,  and  the  ordinate  PN  denoted  by  //.  The axes  may  be  rectangular  or  oblique.  The  abscissa  ,*'  is reckoned  positive  or  negative  according  to  the  position  of  P to  the  right  or  left  of  the  y  axis,  and  the  ordinate  //  is  positive or  negative  according  as-  P  lies  above  or  below  the  x  axis conformably  to  the  rules  (607,  '8).

Also  any  relation  between  the  coefficients  /,  m,  n  in  the equation  of  a  right  line  in  trihnears  will  be  adapted  to  areals by  substituting  /a,  rii{\  M  for  /,  m,  n.

Let  X,  ^,  V  (Fig.  3)  be  the  perpendiculars  from  A,  B,  G upon  EDF,  and  let  pi,  p^,  ih  be  the  perpendiculars  from  A,  B, G  upon  the  opposite  sides  of  the  trigon  ;  then,  by  (4624),  we have

Let  one  of  the  vertices  (0)  of  the  trigon  in  that  system  be  at  infinity (Fig.  3).     Then  equation  (4022)  becomes

4123  To  express  the  equation  of  the  tangent,  or  normal,  in terms  of  m  and  the  constants  of  the  curve.
From  the  equation  of  the  tangent  or  normal,  the  equation  to the  curve,  and  the  equation  furnished  by  the  value  ofm,  eliminate x'  y',  the  coordinates  of  the  point  of  contact  of  the  tangent.
THEORY  OF  POLES   AND   POLARS.
4124     Let  F(x,  y,  x,  y)  =  0  represent  the  equation  to  the tangent  of  a  curve  at  the  point  x'y'.
Then  F{x,  y,  x,  y')  =  0,  the  equation  obtained  by  inter- changing the  constants  x',y'  with  tlie  variables ;«,  7/,  represents the  polar  of  any  fixed  point  x'y'  not  on  the  curve.
Let  Xyiji,  x^y^  (Fig.  19)  be  points  A,  B  on  the  curve,  and  let  the  tangents at  those  points  intersect  in  x'y'.     Consider  the  equations Fix,.y,,x,y)=Q. ..(}),     F(x„y„  x,y)  =  0  ...  (2),     F(x,7j,  x',y')  =  0  ...  (3).
Here  (1),  (2)  are  the  tangents,  and  (3)  is  some  straight  line  or  curve according  to  the  dimensions  of  x  and  y.    Also  (3)  passes  through  the  points

of  contact  .^'j//,,  r/'o'/o,  and  raay  therefore  be  called  the  cicrve  of  contact-;  or,  if  a right  line,  the  chi)nl  of  contact  of  tangents  drawn  from  x\  y\  i.e.,  the  polar.
4125  Heuco  the  coordinates  of  the  points  of  contact  of tangents  from  an  external  point  ,i"'v/'  will  be  determined  b}^ solving  (3)  and  the  equation  of  the  curve  simultaneously.
4126  Again,  let  x'y  (Figs.  20  and  21)  be  any  point  P  not  on  the  curve. Then,  from  the  equations
F(x,y\x,y)=0...i4),  F  (x,y,x.„y,)  =  0  ...(o),  F  (x,y,  .r,,y,)  =  0 ...  (G), we  see  that  (4)  is  some  straight  line ;  that,  if  x.j,y^  and  x^y^  are  any  two  points upon  it,  (5)  and  (6)  are  the  curves  of  contact  of  tangents  from  those  points  ; and  that  these  curves  of  contact  pass  through  the  point  x'y'.
4127  If  the  points  x.^j/^,  x^y^  are  taken  at  A,  B,  where  (4)  intersects  the curve,  (5)  and  (6)  then  become  curves  touching  the  given  curve  at  A  and  B, and  passing  through  x'y'.  We  may  call  these  lines  the  curve  tangents from  x'y'.
4128  Lastly,  let  xy'  in  (o)  be  a  point  within  the  given  curve  (Fig.  22), then  the  equations
F(x,y,x',y')=0...(7),  F  (x„y,,x,y)  =  0  ...  (8),  F  (x,,y„x,y)  =  0  ...  (9) show  that  (7)  is  the  locus  of  a.  point,  the  curve  tangents  from  which  have their  chord  of  contact  always  passing  through  a  fixed  point.  When  x'y'  is without  the  curve,  as  in  Fig.  (19),  the  same  definition  applies  to  every  part of  the  hicus  (3)  from  which  tangents  can  be  drawn.
4129  If  the  given  curve  be  of  a  degree  higher  than  the second,  the  line  of  contact  of  the  tangents  from  a  point  is  a curve,  and  the  line  of  contact  of  the  curve  tangents  from  a point  is  a  straight  line  (Figs.  19  and  20).  A  similar  converse relation  is  exhibited  in  Figures  (21)  and  (22).
If  the  curve  be  of  the  second  degree,  equations  (o)  and (4)  become  identical.  The  line  of  contact  or  the  polar  is always  in  this  case  a  straight  line,  and  so  is  the  locus  (7).
Figures  (19)  and  (20)  now  become  identical,  as  also  (21) and  (22).
4130  The  polar  of  the  point  of  intersection  of  two  right lines  with  regard  to  a  conic  passes  through  their  poles.
Proof. — As  in  (4124).  Let  (1)  and  (2)  be  the  two  lines,  (,t,.Vi),  (^VJi) their  poles,  and  x'y'  their  point  of  intersection.
GENERAL  METHODS.  577
4131  To  find  the  ratio  in  which  the  line  joining  two  given points  xy,  x'y'  is  cut  by  the  curve  /(x,  y)  =  0.
Substitute  for  x  and  y,   the  supposed  coordinates  of  the point  of  intersection i  the  values
n-\-n  n-\-n
and  determine  the  ratio  n  :  n'  from  the  resulting  equation. The  real  roots  of  this  equation  correspond  to  the  real  points  of intersection.
4132  To  form  the  equation  of  all  the  tangents  that  can  be drawn  to  the  curve  from  a  point  x'y' .
Express  the  condition  for  equal  roots  of  the  equation  in (4131),  and  consider  xy  a  variable  point.
4133  To  form  the  equation  of  the  lines  drawn  from  x'y'  to all  the  points  of  intersection  of  two  curves.
Substitute  7ix-\-n'x,  ny' -\-n'y  for  x  and  y  in  both  curves, and  eliminate  the  ratio  n  :  n  .
Proof. — Take  any  other  point  xy  on  the  line  through  xij  and  a  point  of intersection.  The  ratio  n  :  n  (4131)  is  the  same  for  each  curve,  and  there- fore may  be  eliminated.
4134  To  find  the  length,  r  =  AP  or  AP'  (Fig.  23),  of  the segment  intercepted  between  the  point  A  or  x'y'  and  the  curve /  {x,  y)  =  0  on  a  straight  line  drawn  from  A  at  an  inclination 9  to  the  X  axis.  That  is,  to  form  the  polar  equation  with x'y'  for  the  pole  and  the  initial  line  parallel  to  the  x  axis.
Substitute  for  X.  and  y,  the  assumed  coordinates  of  the  point of  intersection,  the  values  x  =  ON  or  ON',  y  =  PN  or  P'N',
that  is,  X  =  .r'+r  cos^,         j  =:  y'-\-r  ^m.6,
and  determine  r  from  the  resulting  equation.  That  is,  put a  =  0  in  (4051).
The  real  values  of  r  are  the  distances  of  the  points  of  inter- section from  x'y'.
4135  When  an  equation  has  been  obtained  for  determining X  the  length  of  a  line,  important  results  may  frequently  be arrived  at  by  applying  theorem  (406)  respecting  the  sum  and product  of  the  roots.

4160  Let        S  =  {.v-ay-\-{?j-hy-'r'  =  0
be  any  circle  (Fig.  27).  Then,  if  xij  be  a  point  P  outside  the circle,  S  becomes  tbe  square  of  the  tangent  from  P.  If  xy  be a  point  P'  within  the  circle,  S  becomes  minus  the  square  of the  ordinate  drawn  through  P'  at  right  angles  to  the  radius throu2:h  P'.

Proof. — The  coordinates  of  the  three  centres  of  the  forms  (4174,  '75) will  in  each  case  satisfy  equation  (4083).
4177  The  equation  of  the  external  axis  of  similitude  is,  in determinant  notation  (554),

Proof. — By  eliminating  R  and  cos  a  between  three  equations,  like  (4180).
4188  Each  of  these  four  perpendiculars  contains  the  centres of  two  circles  touchino-  the  three  o-iven  circles.
Proof.— Consider  a  =  0  or  180',  in  (4180).
To  draw  the  eight  circles  which  touch  three  given  circles, see  (946)  and  (1049).

Proof.— (Fig.  30.)     By  turning  the  axes  in  (4404)  through  the  angle  6 (4049)  and  equating  the  new  h  to  zero.

Tlie  transformed  equation  now  becomes
4409  «V+6y+c'  =  0,
4410  iu  which  ti  =^{a-\-b+  \/m^+(«-6)^ } ,
4411  b'  =  i  {a-\-b-v'4sh'-\-{a-by} , a  and  b'  are  found  from  the  two  equations
4412  a-\-b'  =  (i-^b,         ab' =  ab  —  h\        [See  (4418). The  semi-axes  aiid  excentricity  are

4416  Note. — If  B  be  the  acute  angle  determined  by  equation (4408),  we  have  to  choose  between  9  and  0-\-^  for  the  inclina- tion  in  question,  since  tan  20  is  also  equal  to  tan  (20  +  7r).
Rule.* — For  the  ellipse,  the  inclination  of  the  major  axis to  the  X  axis  of  coordinates  will  be  the  acute  angle  6  or  0  +  ^7r, according  as  h  and  c'  have  the  same  or  different  signs.  For  the hyperbola,  read  "  dfferent  or  the  same.''
Proof. — Let  the  transformed  equation  (4409)  be  written  in  terms  of  the semi-axes  p,  2 ;  thus  cfx'^+p'y'^  ^  jfcf,  representing  an  ellipse.  Now  turn the  axes  back  again  through  the  angle  —d,  and  we  get
{q^  cos^  6  +f  sin^  d)  X'-  (p'^-c/)  sin  2$  xy  +  {(f  sin^  d-\-p^  cos'  0)  t/^  =  p\\
Comparing  this  with  the  identical  equation  (4404),   ax^  +  21ixy-\-hi/ ■= —g\
we  have  ip'^  —  'i)  sin  29  =  —  2/i,         p-q^  =  —  c';
sin20  =  ^.^^„.  Hence  ^  is    < -J
c     p'  —  q"  2
when  h  and  c'  have  the  same  sign,  p  being  >q.  A  similar  investigation applies  to  the  hyperbola  by  changing  the  sign  of  g'.
*  This  rule  and  the  demonstration  of  it  are  due  to  Mr.  George  Heppel,  M.A.,   of Hammersmith.

INVARIANTS  OF  THE  CONIC.
4417  Transformation  of  the  origin  of  coordinates  alone does  not  alter  the  values  of  a,  h,  or  h,  whether  the  axes,  be rectangular  or  oblique.     This  is  seen  in  (4404).
When  the  axes  are  rectangular,  turning  each  through  an angle  9  does  not  affect  the  values  of
4418  ab-h',     «+6,     ^^-4-/^     or   c.
When  the  axes  are  oblique  (inclination  w),  transformation in  any  manner  does  not  affect  the  values  of  the  expressions
4422  .  ,         and     —^ — ^^  
These  theoi'ems  may  be  proved  by  actual  transformation  by  the  formulae in  (4048-50) .  For  other  methods  and  additional  invariants  of  the  conic,  see (4951).
4424  If  the  axes  of  coordinates  are  oblique,  equation  (4400) is  transformed  to  the  centre  in  the  same  way,  and  equations (4402-6)  still  hold  good.  If  the  final  equation  referred  to  axes coinciding  with  those  of  the  conic  be
4425  a\v'-^h'ii'-\-c'  =  0,
and  0  the  inchnation  of  the  new  axis  of  ,i'  to  the  old  one,  we shall  have  c  unaltered,

The  eccentricity  of  the  general  conic  (4400)  is  given  by the  equation
4429  __£!_  _  (a  +  b-2li  cos  coy  _^
Proof. — By  (4415),  and  the  invariants  in  (4422).
THE   PARABOLA.
4430  When  ab  —  Jr  =  0,  the  general  equation  (4400)  repre- sents a  parabola.
For  X,  y'  in  (4402)  then  become  infinite  and  the  cui^ve  has no  centre,  or  the  centre  may  be  considered  to  recede  to infinity.
Tui^n  the*  axes  of  coordinates  at  once  through  an  angle  % (4049),  and  in  the  transformed  equation  let  the  new  coeffi- cients be  a,  111,  h\  2c/,  2/ ,  c'.     Equate  li  to  zero;  this  gives
2/? (4408)  again,  tan  26  =  — -.     If  6  be  the  acute  angle  deter- mined by  this  equation,  we  can  decide  whether  9  or  9-\-^Tr  is the  angle  between  the  x  axis  and  the  axis  of  the  parabola  by the  following  rule.
4431  KuLE. —  The  inclination  of  the  axis  of  the  imvahola  to the  X  axis  of  coordinates  will  be  tJie  acute  angle  9  fh.  has  the opposite  sign  to  that  o/a  or  b,  and  9-\-\Tr  if  it  has  the  same sign.
Proof. — Since  ah  —  h^  =  0,  a  and  h  have  the  same  sign.  Let  that  sign be  positive,  changing  signs  throughout  if  it  is  not.  Then,  for  a  point  at infinity  on  the  curve,  x  and  y  will  take  the  same  sign  when  the  inclination  is the  acute  angle  9,  and  opposite  signs  when  it  is  O  +  ^tt.  But,  since ax^^lif  =  +00  ,  we  must  have  2hxij  =  —  co,  the  terms  of  the  first  degree vanishing  in  comparison.  Hence  the  sign  of  h  determines  the  angle  as  stated in  the  rule.
4432  -"<'=V46'       •^°«''  =  V^-
Proof.— From  the  value  of  tan  20  above,  d  being  the  acute  angle  obtained, and  from  /t^  =  ab.
4434     Also  a  =  0     and     h'  =  a  +  b.
For   a'b'  =  ab  —  lr  =  0,   and  we  ensure  that  a'  and  not  6' vanishes    by (4431).     Also  a+b'  =  a+b  (4412).

(Fig.  31),  7  and  g  are  the  absciss93  of  D  and  D\  its  extremities, the  tangents  at  those  points  being  parallel  to  the  y  axis.  The surd  =  PN  =  FN  when  x  —  OM.  The  axes  may  be  rect- angular or  oblique.
When  ah  —  ]r  =  0,  equation  (4446)  becomes

4460  where       p  =  bg—hf,     q=p—bc.

RULES  FOR  THE  ANALYSIS  OF  THE  GENERAL  EQUATION.
First  examine  the  value  of  ab— h^  and,  if  this  is  not  zero, calculate  the  numerical  value  of  c  (4407),  and  j^roceed  as  in (4400)  et  seq.  If  ab— h^  is  zero,  find  the  values  ofip'  and  q' (4459).     The  following  are  the  cases  that  arise.
4464  ab—h-  positive — Locus  an  ellipse.
Particular  Gases.
4465  ^  =  0 — Locus  the  point  xy'.
See  (4402).     For,  by  (4404),  the  conjugate  axes  vanish.
4466  6A  positive — No  locus.
By  (4447-54),  since  q—p^  is  then  positive.
4467  /i  =  0  and  a  =  b — Locus  a  circle.
By  (4144).  In  other  cases  proceed  as  in  (4400-14),
4468  ab—h^  negative — Locus  an  hyperbola.
Particular  Gases.
4469  A  =  0 — Locus   two   right   lines  intersecting   in   the point  xy'.
By  (4447),  since  g—p^  then  vanishes.     In  this  case  solve  as  in  (4447).
606  CARTESIAN  ANyiLYTICAL  CONICS.
4470  bA  negative — Locus  the  conjugate  hyperbola.
4471  a-\-b  =  0 — Locus  the  rectangular  hyperbola.
By  (4414),  since  a'=  —h'.
4472  a  =  b  =  0 — Locus  an  hyperbola,  with  its  asymptotes parallel  to  the  coordinate  axes.    The  coordinates  of  the  centre
are  now  —^  and   — -^,  by  (4402).     Transfer  the  origin  to the  centre,  and  the  equation  becomes
4473  ■''^=T-
In  other  cases  proceed  as  in  (4400-14).
4474  ah  —  h^  =  0 — Locus  a  parabola.
Particular  Gases.
4475  |/  =  0 — Locus  two  parallel  right  lines.  By  (4459).
4476  J)'  =  q  =  0 — Locus  two  coinciding  right  lines. By  (4459).
4477  Ji'  =  0  and  (/  negative — No  locus.
^  By  (4459).     In  other  cases  proceed  as  in  (4430-43).
Ex.  1.:  2x'^-2xy+y'  +  3x-y-l  =  0.
3  1
Here  the  values  of  a,  li,  h,  (j,  f,  c  are  respectively  2,  —1,  1,   --,    —  — ,   —1,
G  ah  —  h-  4
The  locus  is  therefore  an  ellipse,  none  of  the  exceptions  (44G5-7)  occurring here.     The  coordinates  of  the  centre,  by  (4402),  are
'  _  kf-bg  _  _i         „'  _  f/^'-"/ _  _  1
ah  —  h'  ab  —  k  '1
Hence  the  equation  transformed  to  the  centre  is
2x'-2xy  +  y'-^  =  0.
Turning  the  axes  of  coordinates  through   an  angle  0  so  that  tan29=— 2 (4408),  we  find  the  new  a  and  h  from
a'  +  6'  =  3,         ah'  =  \;     (4412)
THE  GENERAL  EQUATION.  607
therefore  a'  =  i  (3-^/5),     b'  =  ^  (3+  v/5),
and  the  final  equation  becomes     2  (3—  v/5)  a;^  +  2  (3+  ^/5)  ?/*  =  9.
The  inclination  of  the  major  axis  to  the  original  x  axis  of  coordinates  is the  acute  angle  ^tan"^  (  —  2),  by  the  rule  in  (4416).
Ex.  (2):  12x'  +  60xy  +  75y'-12x-8y-6  =  0.
The  values  of  a,  h,  b,  g,f,  c  are  respectively  12,  30,  75,  —6,  —4,  —6,
a6-7i^  =  0;        p'  =  bg-hf= -330;         q'=f-bc.         (4460)
Since  jj'  does  not  vanish   (4475-7),  the  locus  is  a  parabola.     Proceeding, therefore,  by  (4430-43),  we  have
ta.29  =  ^^  =  -|;         sm«  =  ^,  cos e  = -l^.    (4432)
By  the  rule  (4431),  we  must  take  O+^tt  for  the  angle,  instead  of  6.    There-
fore  g=-gsme+/cosg=      ^^^J^^      = -^.
y  = -/sine-,  cos  0=      %43       =729- and  6'  =  a  +  6  =  87  (4435).
Consequently  the  transformed  equation  is
Q^7  2  I      44        ,64  ^        ^
^^^  +"729"+ 729^-^ -^  =  ^- The  coordinates  of  the  vertex  are  computed  by  (4441),  and  the  final
44 87x/29*'
Ex.  (3) :  x'  +  6xy+9y'  +  bx  +  15y  +  6  =  0.
The  values  of  a,  h,  b,  g,f,  c  are  respectively  1,  3,  9,  — ,  — ,  6,
ab  —  W  =  0      and      p  =  bg  —  kf  =  0,
therefore,  by  (4475-7),  if  there  is  a  locus  at  all,  it  consists  of  two  parallel  or coinciding  lines.     Solving  the  equation  therefore  as  a  quadratic  in  y,  we obtain  it  in  the  form        (x  +  oy  +  2)  (x  +  Sy  +  S)  =  0, the  equation  of  two  parallel  right  lines.

CONTACT  OF  CONICS.
4527  Def. — When  two  points  of  intersection  of  two  curves coincide  on  a  common  tangent,  the  curves  have  a  contact  of ihQ first  order;  when  three  such  points  coincide,  a  contact  of the  second  order ;  and  so  on.  To  osculate,  is  to  have  a  con- tact higher  than  the  first.

4531  If  the  points  L,  M  coincide,  the  conies  have  contact of  the  first  order.  The  condition  for  this  is  that  (4530)  must have  equal  roots ;  therefore
4533  {ag'  -  ag)  (bg'  -  b'g)  =  {lig  -  h'g)\
4533  If  the  conies  (1)  and  (2)  are  to  osculate,  M  must coincide  with  0.     Therefore,  in  (4529),  hg'  =  Vg.
If  in  (4532)   hg'  =  h'g,  the  conies  have  a  contact  of  the third  order.

CONFOCAL  CONICS.
4550  ^  +  |l=:l      and     4  +  1^=1
are  confocal  conies,  if

or  the  sign  of  h'''^  may  be  changed.
For  the  confocal  of  the  general  conic,  see  (5007).
4551  Confocal  conies  intersect,  if  at  all,  at  right  angles.
Proof. — If  «,  «'  are  the  two  conies  in  (4550),  changing  the  sign  of  h""  to make  the  second  conic  an  hyperbola,  «  — «'=0  will  be  satisfied  at  their  point of  intersection  ;  and  {hj  a' —  a"^  =  If' -\-h'')  this  proves  the  tangents  at  that point  to  be  at  right  angles  (4078,  4280).
Otherwise  geometrically  by  (1168).
4552  Tangents  from  a  point  P  on  one  conic  to  a  confocal conie  make  equal  angles  with  the  tangent  at  P.      [Proof  at  (1291)

4555  Grai-cs'  Theorem.  —  The  two  tangents  drawn  to  an ellipse  from  a  point  on  a  confocal  ellipse  together  exceed  the intercepted  arc  by  a  constant  quantity.
Proof. — (Fig.  132.)  Let  P,  P'  be  consecutive  points  on  the  confocal  from which  the  tangents  are  drawn.  Let  fall  the  perpendiculars  FN,  P'N'.  From (1291),  it  follows  that  /.FP'N  =  F'FN',  and  therefore  P'jV  =  P^".  The increment  in  the  sum  of  the  tangents  in  passing  from  P  to  P'  is
BB'  -  QQ'  +  P'N- FN'  =  BB'  -  Q  Q'. But  this  is  also  the  increment  in  the  arc  QB,  which  proves  the  theorem.
4556  M  the  tangents  are  drawn  from  a  confocal  hyperbola, as  in  (Fig.  133),  the  difference  of  the  tangents  PQ,  FB  is equal  to  the  difference  of  the  arcs  QT,  BT.
•The  proof  is  quite  similar  to  the  foregoing.

Pkoof. — The  origin  B  is  one  common  focus  of  the  reciprocal  conies,  by (4844).  The  polar  of  P  with  respect  to  any  of  the  circles  is  the  same  line, by  (41GG).  P  and  its  polar  (both  fixed)  reciprocate  (4858)  into  the  line  at infinity  and  its  polar,  which  is  the  centre  of  the  conic.  The  centre  and  one focus  bcinc:  the  same  for  all,  the  conies  are  confocal.

For  a  description  of  this  system  of  coordinates,  see  (4006). The  square  of  the  distance  between  two  points  aj3y,  a'/3'y  is, with  the  notation  of  (4008),
4601
4602 =  ^  [a  cos^  (a-a  )-hl)  cos^  (i8-/8')^+r  cosC(y-y)1.
Proof. — Let  P,  Q  be  the  points.     By  drawiag  the  coordinates  /?y,  fi'y', it  is  easily  seen,  by  (702),  that
pg^  =  [(/3-/3T+{y-yT  +  2(/3-/5')(r-y')cos^]cosec^4   (I).
Now,  by  (4007),      a  (a- a')  +  b(/5-/3')  +  0(7-7')  =0,
from  which   b(f3-i3'y  =  -a(a-a')(/3-/3')-c(/3-/3')(7-y'),

When  I  and  m  have  tlie  same  sign,  the  line  divides  the  external  angle  C of  the  triangle  ABC;  when  of  opposite  sign,  the  internal  angle  C.
The  general  equation  of  a  straight  Hne  is
4605  /a+my8+«7  =  0,
and  it  may  be  referred  to  as  the  Une  (/,  m,  ??).
Proof:  la  +  mft  =  0  is  aritj  line  through  the  point  C,  and  (la  +  mft)-^ny =  0  is  any  line  through  the  intersection  of  the  former  line  and  the  line  7=0 (4604),  and  therefore  any  line  whatever  according  to  the  values  of  the  arbi- trary constants  /,  m,  n.

Or,  if  the  equations  of  the  sides  of  ABC  are  given  in  the form  Arr-\-B^y-\-Gi  =  0,  &c.,  the  hne  becomes

4608  If  ''  =  ^K  '■  =  ^i  '"  =  ^  are  the  general  equations  of the  hnos  a,  /3,  y,  then  it  is  obvious  that  lu-\-mv  =  0  is,  like (4604),  a  line  passing  through  the  intersection  of  u  and  Vy  and Jn-\-mn^nw  =  0  represents  any  straight  line  whatever.
To  make  an  equation  such  as  a  =  p  (a  constant)  liomo- geneous  in  a,  /3,  y;  multiply  by  the  equation  S  =  aa -f^/S  +  Cy (4007),  thus

where     D  =  n  (mn  —  m'n)  +1)  [nl'  —  n'l)  -f  t  {Im'  —  I'm) .

aa  + 1)/3  +  cy  =  S,  ^a  +  m/3  +  ny  =  0,  I'a  +  m'ft  +  n'y  =  0.
The  equation
4612  aa+l)i8+Cy  =  0     or     a  sin  ^+i8sin  J5+y  sin  C  =  0
represents  a  straight  line  at  infinity.
Proof.  —  The    coordinates    of    its    intersection    with    any    other    line Za+WjS  +  ny  =  0  are  infinite  by  (4611).
4613  Note:  ar«  +  B/3  +  cy  =  2,  a  quantity  not  zero.  The  equation (^a-\-hft-{-(.y  =  0  is  therefore  in  itself  impossible,  and  so  is  a  line  infinitely distant.  The  two  conceptions  are,  however,  together  consistent;  the  one involves  the  other.  And  if,  in  the  equation  Za  +  m/3  +  ?iy  =  0,  the  ratios I  :  m  :  n  approach  the  values  a  :  fc  :  c,  the  line  it  represents  recedes  to  an unlimited  distance  from  the  trigou.
4614  The  equation  corresponding  to  (4612)  in  Cartesian  coordinates  is Oa;  +  0?/ +  6^  =  0,  the  intercepts  on  the  axes  being  both  infinite.  Cartesian coordinates  may  therefore  be  regarded  as  trilinear  with  the  x  and  y  axes  for two  sides  of  the  trigon  and  the  other  side  at  an  infinite  distance.
4615  The  condition  that  three  points aii3i7i,  a.,l^zy2,  «3/3373  may  lie  on  the  same straight  line  is  the  determinant  equation,

4643     Centre  of  tlie  nine-point  circle  (or  mid-cpntre) : cos  (B-C)  :  cos  (G-A)  :  cos  (A-B).
Proof. — By  (955)  the  coordinates  are  the  arithmetic  means  of  the  corres- ponding coordinates  of  the  orthocentre  and  circum-ceutre.     Therefore,  by

Similarly,  by  the  coordinates  in  (4643),  it  may  be  shown  that  the  mid- centre  iV  lies  on  the  same  line.

a  sin 2^  sin  (B-C) +13  sin  25  sin  (C-yl) -|-y  sin  2C  sin  (A-B)  =0.
Ex.  3. — Similarly,  from  (4629,  '42),  the  line  drawn  through  the  centres of  the  inscribed  and  circumscribed  circles  is
a  (cos  B— cos  6')+/3  (cos  C—co{iA)  +  y  (cos  J.  — cos  B)  =  0.
Ex.  4. — A  parallel  to  ^B  drawn  through  C: a  sin  A  +/3  sin  B=  0. For  this  is  a  line  through  a/3,  by  (4604),  and  the  equation  difiVrs  only  by  a constant  from    y  =  0,  for  it  may  be  written
(a  sin.l  +  /^  sinL'  +  y  sin  C)—y  sin  ("■  =  0.
Ex.  5. — A  poi  })endicular  to  BG  drawn  through  C  is «  cos  0  -h  /3  =  0.
For  a  peipeiidicnlar  is       /3  cos  7?  — y  cos  (7  =  0  (4633)         (1),
and  a  line  through  C  is  of  the  form  /d  +  »i/j  =  0.  Hence,  by  (4619),  the constant  Ic  (a  sin  A  +  ji  sin  B  +  y  sin  C)  must  be  added  to  (I)  so  as  to  elimi- nate y.     Thus

ANHARMONIC   RATIO.
For  the  definition,  see  (1052).
4648  The  three  ratios  of  that  article  are  the  vakies  of  the ratio  h  :  k'  in  the  three  following  pencils  of  four  lines  respec- tively—
a  =  0,  a-kfi  =  0,  /8  =  0,  a+///3  =  0...  (i.)  (Fig.  34), a=0,  a-^y8==0,  a^k'l3  =  0,  /3  =  0...  (ii.)  (Fig.  35), a  =  0,      /3  =  0,      a+A-/3  =  0,     a+k'/S  =  0...(iu:}    (Fig.  36).
4649  The  anharmonic  ratio  (i.)  becomes  harmonic  when h  =  h'.  Hence  the  lines  a-\-h^,  a  —  l'P  form  a  harmonic  pencil with  the  hnes  a,  j3,  the  first  dividing  the  external  and  the second  the  internal  angle  between  a  and  /3  (Fig.  37).
4650  Similarly,  the  anharmonic  ratio  of  four  lines  whose equations  are
is  the  fraction
(a^i— M2)  i^h—fh)
Proof. — Let  OL  be  the  Hue  a  =  0,  and OB,  13  =  0.
fx^—/d^  =  difference  of  perpendiculars  from A  and  B  upon  OL,  divided  by  p.
Similarly,  ^3  — i^i,  &c.  These  differences are  proportional  to  the  segments  AB,  CD, AD,  BC,  and  jj  is  a  common  divisor.
4651     Homographic  pencils  of  hnes  are  those  which  have  the same  anharmonic  ratio.     Thus  the  two  pencils
a  — /iiii3,       a  —^^2/3,       a  — ^tg/S,       a  — ^ii/3,
and  a'— ^ii/3',     o'  — ^i./B',     a—f.L.^(i',     o'— ^ii/3',
are  homographic  pencils.

The  equa- tions of  the  different  lines  may  be  written  as  under,  with  the aid  of  ijroposition  (4604),  the  ratios  I :  m  :  n  being  arbitrary and  dependent  upon  the  position  of  0.

The  general  equation  of  tlie  second  degree  is

This  equation  will  be  denoted  by  <^  (o,  /3,  7)  =  0   or   n  =  0. Equation  of  the  tangent  or  polar :

628  TBILINEAB  ANALYTICAL  CONICS.
Proof.  — By  the  methods  in  (4120).  Otherwise  by  (4678);  let  a/3y be  on  the  curve  ;  then  <p  (a,  /3,  y)  =  0.  Next  let  the  point  where  the  line  cuts the  curve  move  up  to  afty.  Then  the  line  becomes  a  tangent  and  the ratio  n  :  n'  vanishes;   the  condition  for  this  gives  equation  (4G58).

4660  aa-]-hft+oy  =  0,    /,a+^,;8+/y=:0,    o-a4-/;8+fy  =  0.
4661  The  condition  that  u  may  break  up  into  two  linear factors  representing  two  right  lines  is,  by  (4469),  A  =  0, where

4663  The  general  tangential  equation of  the  conic  (4656)  expresses  the  condi- tion that  the  line  XaH-/n|3  +  vy  may  touch the  curve  and  is  the  determinant  equation annexed.     The  same  written  in  full  is

4665  or  AX'+BfM'-^Cv'^2Fiiv-{-2Gv\+2H\fx  =  0; writing,  as  in  (1642),
A  =  bc—f\  B  =  ca—g\  C  =  ab—h\
F  =  gh-(if,         G  =  hf-bg,         H  =fg-ch.
The  tangential  equation  will  be  denoted  by  (1>  (X,  ^t,  v)  =  0  or Z7=  0,  to  correspond  with  (4656).
Proof.  —  The  determinant  is  the  eliminant  of  the  equation  of  the  line Xa  +  fi/3  +  j^7  =  0,  and  the  three  equations  obtained  by  equating  X,  ^u,  v  to  the coefficients  of  o,  /3,  y  in  (4059).
Otherwise. — Assume  Xa  +  ^/3  +  >'y  =  0  for  the  tangent.  Substitute  the value  of  the  ratio  /3  :  y  obtained  from  it  in  the  equation  of  the  curve,  and express  the  condition  for  equal  roots  (4119).
4666  Conversely,  if  the  line  Xa  -h^t/3 -\-vy  has  the  coefficients  X,  ^t,  v  con- nected by  the  equation  of  the  second degree  Z7  =  0  (4664),  then  the  enve- lope of  the  line  is  the  conic  in  the

4668  or  A  {aa'-^bfi'+cf+2fl3y-^2oya-\-2ha/B)  =  0.
Proof. — Eliminate  )'  from  U  =z  0  and  the  given  line.  The  result  is  of the  form  I/\^  +  2EAjLt  + JIju'^  =  0,  and  therefore  the  envelope  is  LM  —  B^,  by (4792).  This  produces  equation  (46G7).  The  coefficients  are  the  first minors  of  the  reciprocal  determinant  of  A  (1G43),  and  therefore,  by  (585), are  equal  to  aA,  6A,  &c.
4669  The  condition  that  U  may  consist  of  two  Hnear  factors is,  as  in  (4661),   D  =  0,  where
4670  D  =  ABC+2FGH-AF'-BG'-CH'  =^\     (1643)
In  this  case  ?7  becomes  the  equation  of  two  points,  since  the line  Aa+^ij3-|-vy  must  pass  through  one  or  other  of  two  fixed points.     See  (4913).
4671  The  coordinates  of  the  pole  of  Xa+/i/3  +  vy  are  as A\+H,.i-\-Gv  :  H\-\-Bfi+Fv  :  GX-^F^i+Cv,
4672  or  U^:U,:  U,.
Proof. — By  (4659)   we  have   the  equations  in   the     '^^^.io,T!^'Z  I' margin,  the  solution  of  which  gives  the  ratios  of  a  :  (3  :  ■/.      "'  _^  j  ^  _|_*^     _  ^.^^^

Hence  the  tangential  equation  of  the  pole  of  X'a  +  //3  +  v'y, i.e.,  the  condition  that  Xa  +  ^ijS  +  vy  may  pass  through  the pole ;  or,  in  other  words,  that  the  two  lines  may  be  mutually conjugate,  is

Pjjoof. — The  point  a'/3',  where  y  meets  the  curve,  is  found  from au"-  +  2ha'iy  +  hiy'-  =  0  [y  =  0  in  (4G56)].  The  tangent  at  such  a  point  is ny  +  u^jy'  =  0  (4658).     Eliminate  a',  /3'.
The  equation  of  a  pair  of  tangents  from  al3'y  is

Proof. — By  the  condition  for  equal  roots  of  (4678). By  actual  expansion  the  equation  becomes (^]>y2+Glo'-2Flh)  cP  +  iCa'  -{-Ay'-2Gya)  /3'H(^l/3'  +  iV  -2/fa/5)  y'- +  2(-Al3y  +  nya  +  Gui3-Fa')tyy'

In  which  either  a',  /i',  y'  or  o,  /?,  y  may  be  the  variables,  for  the  forms  are convertible.
Otlierwise  the  equation  of  the  two  tangents  is

Otherwise  tlie  equation,  in  a  form  homogeneous  in a,  /3,  y,  is
4684  (aa,+lj;8o+rro)  ^(^,^,7)  =  k{na-\-hl3+CyY   (2),
where  n,  I),  t  are  the  sides  of  the  trigon.
And,  finally,  if  the  tangential  equation  (4664)  be  denoted by  O  (A,^i,  v)  =  0,  the  equation  of  the  asymptotes  may  be presented  in  the  form
4685  a>(a,Ij,r)(^(a,A7)  =  (aa+l)y8+r7rA   (3).
Proof. — (i.)   The  asymptotes  are  identical  with  a  pair  of  tangeuts  from the  centre ;  therefore,  put  a^,  jj^,  y^  for  o',  /3',  y'  in  (4680)  ;  thus
<t>  (">  fi,  y)  f  ("o' l\,  ra)  =  ^•'  ('^«  +  fV'  +  cry  =  k'T   (4),
since  the  polar  becomes  the  line  at  infinity.
N'ow,  multiplying  the  three  equations  in  (4672)  by  a,  /3,  y  respectively, and  adding,  we  obtain  (j)  (a,  ft,  y)  =  Jc  (Xa  +  nft  +  yy),  and  therefore
0K,/3o,yo)  =  A-(ar.  +  [v3  +  cy)  =  /.-2   (5),
since  the  line  at  infinity  (4612)  is  the  pole  of  the  centre.
From  (4)  and  (5),  by  eliminating  A-,  equation  (1)  is  produced  ;  and  by dividing  (4)  by  (5),  we  get  equation  (2).
Again,  taking  the  values  of  a,  ft,  y  from  (4673),  we  have
^-  +  ^^^  +  ^y  =  HKj^^    ^,a  therefore  ^^o+J^/'o  +  ^/o  =  *1^^M). k  ^  k  A
By  the  last  equation,  (2)  is  converted  into  (3).     See  also  (40GG).

4688     The  area  of  the  conic  =       TrSalJCA
Proof.— If  the  roots  of  the  quadratic  (4687)  are  ±rr\  rfcr.;'-,  the  area will  be  7rri?-2.  The  coefficient  of  r"'' reduces  by  trigonometry  to  —  SV,  and the  absolute  term  is  —4'  (a,  t,  c).     Hence  the  product  of  the  roots  is  found.
4689  The  conic  will  be  an  ellipse,  hyperbola,  or  parabola, according  as   ^^  (n,i),C)    (4664)  is  positive,  negative,  or  zero.
Proof. — The  squares  of  the  semi-axes  have  opposite  signs  in  the  hypei*- bola.  Therefore  the  product  of  the  roots  of  the  quadratic  (4687)  must  for an  hypei'bola  be  negative,  and  therefore  <1»  negative  in  (4688).
4>  (a,  h,  c)  =  0  makes  the  curve  touch  the  line  at  infinity  (4664),  a  pro- perty which  distinguishes  the  parabola.
The  condition  that  the  general  conic  (4656)   may  be  a rectangular  hyperbola  is

Proof. — Let  the  asymptotes  be
/a  +  mft  +  ny  =  0,  I'a  +  m'(3  +  n'y  =  0.
Forming    the    product,    equating    coefficients    with  (4685),    and    denoting (j)  (a,  b,  c)  by  <?>,  we  get  the  proportions

We  may  therefore  substitute  these  denominators  in  (4620)  for  the  condition of  perpendicularity  of  the  asymptotes.  The  result  reduces  to  the  equation above,  by  (837).
For  another  method,  see  (5002).

Proof. — The  equation  of  a  pair  of  tangents  (4681)  through  a  point  o^y in  trilinears,  when  the  tangents  are  at  right  angles,  represents  the  limiting case  of  a  rectangular  hyperljola.  Therefore  the  ecination  referred  to  must have  the  coefficients  of  a',  /3'",  &c.  connected  by  the  relation  in  (4690), which  thus  becomes  the  equation  of  the  locus  of  the  point  a^y ;  i.e.,  the director-circle.

ay  =  A-/38.
Proof. — This  is  a  curve  of  the  second  degree,  and  it  passes  through  the points  whei'e  a  meets  /3  and  h,  and  also  where  y  meets  /3  and  d.

By  supposing  one  or  more  of  the  conies  to  become  right  lines,  various  theorems may  be  obtained.

636  TEILINEAB  ANALYTICAL  CONIGS.
4711  The  hyperbola   .vy  =  (Ocr+0//+j>)-
is  of  the  form  (4699),  and  has  for  a  chord  of  contact  at  infinity Oxi-Oy+2^  =  0,  (i;  y  being  the  tangents  from  the  centre.
4712  The  parabola    y^  =  (0^-\-Oy+p)  .v has  the  tangent  at  infinity  Ox-{-Oy-{-p  =  0.
4713  So  the  general  equation  of  a  parabola  may  be  put  in the  form  of  (4699).     Thus
(a.r+/3^)-^+(2^-.v+2/i/+c)(0^+0^/+l)  =  0.
Here  ax  +  fty  is  the  chord  of  contact,  that  is,  a  diameter;  2gx  +  2fy  +  c  is the  finite  tangent  at  its  extremity,  and  Ox  +  Oy  +  1  the  tangent  at  the  other extremity,  supposed  at  infinity.
4714  The  general  conic  may  be  written {cLv'+2kvy-{-bt/)-\-(2g.v-\-2fy-hc){0x-j-0y-^l)  =  0.
For  this  is  of  the  form  ay +  kl3o,  S  being  at  infinity.
4715  The  conies    8    and    S-k{0.v-\-Oij+iy have  double  contact  at  infinity,  and  are  similar.
4716  The  parabolas      8   and    S-k'' have  a  contact  of  the  third  order  at  infinity.
Proof. — For  S  and  S—(0x  +  0y-\-Jiy  have  the  line  at  infinity  for  a  chord of  contact ;  and,  by  (4712),  this  chord  of  contact  is  also  a  tangent  to  both
4717  All  circles  are  said  to  pass  through  the  same  two imaginary  points  at  infinity  (see  4918)  and  through  two  real or  imaginary  finite  points.
Proof. — The  general  equation  of  the  circle  (4144)  may  be  written (x  +  iy)(x-iy)  +  (2gx  +  2fy  +  c)(0x  +  0y  +  l)  =  0; and  this  is  of  the  form  (4G97).     Here  the  lines   x±iy   intersect  Ox  +  Oy  +  1 in  two  imaginary  points  which  have  been  called  the  circular  poi)ds  at  {njinity, and  2(jx  +  2fy  +  c  in  two  finite  points  F,  Q  ;  and  these  points  are  all  situated on  the  locus  x^  +  y'^  +  2gx  +  2fy  +  c  —  0.
4718  Concentric  circles  touch  in  four  imaginary  points  at infinity.
P ARTICULAR  CONIC S.  637
Proof.  —  The  centre  being  the  origin,  equation  (4136)  maybe  written {x  +  iij)(x—{y)  =  {Ox  +  Oi/  +  ry\  which,  by  (4699),  shows  that  the  lines  a;  ±  iy have  each  double  contact  with  the  {supplementanj)  curve  at  infinity,  and  the variation  of  r  does  not  affect  this  result.     Compare  (4711).
4719  The  equation  of  any  conic  may  be  put  in  the  form
^v'+y'  =  ey.
Here  x  =  0,  y  =  0  are  two  sides  of  the  trigon  intersecting  at right  angles  in  the  focus ;  y  =  0,  the  third  side,  is  the  directrix, and  e  is  the  eccentricity.
The  conic  becomes  a  circle  when  e  =  0  and  y  =  oo  ,  so  that ey  =  r,  the  radius,  (4718).
4720  Two  imaginary  tangents  drawn  through  the  focus are,  by  (4699),
{^v+ii/){a:—ii/)  =  0.
These  tangents  are  identical  with  the  lines  drawn  through the  two  circular  points  at  infinity  (see  4717).  Hence,  if  two tangents  be  drawn  to  the  conic  from  each  of  the  circular points  at  infinity,  they  will  intersect  in  two  imaginary  points, and  also  in  two  real  points  which  are  the  foci  of  the  conic.
All  confocal  conies,  therefore,  have  four  imaginary  com- mon tangents,  and  two  opposite  vertices  of  the  quadrilateral formed  by  the  tangents  are  the  foci  of  the  conies.
4721  If  the  axes  are  oblique,  this  universal  form  of  the equation  of  the  conic  becomes
The  two  imaginary  tangents  through  the  focus  must  now be  written
{cV-\-y{cosQ}-\-i  siuco)}  {^v+y  (cosw— i  siuw)}  =  0.
4722  Any  two  lines  including  an  angle  9  form,  with  the lines  drawn  from  the  two  circular  points  at  infinity  to  their point  of  intersection,  a  pencil  of  which  the  anharmonic  ratio
is  e^('^-2«).
Proof. — Take  the  two  lines  for  sides  /3,  y  of  the  trigon.     The  equation of  the  other  pair  of  lines  to  the  circular  points  will  be  obtained  by  elimin-

nna—nhl^+{ltl-mh)  y  =  0.
Proof. — The  coordinates  of  the  point  of  intersection  are  I  :  vi  :  —n,  by (4726-7),  and  the  coordinates  of  the  centre  of  AB  are  b  :  a  :  0.  The diameter  passes  through  these  points,  and  its  equation  is  given  by  (4616).
4733  The  coordinates  of  the  centre  of  the  conic  are  as /(-/a  +  >>*t)  +  /ir)  :  m(/a  — mlj  +  wr)  :  n{l^  +  mh-nt).
Proof. — By  (4610),  the  point  being  the  intersection  of  two  diameters like  (4732).     Otherwise,  by  (4677).
4734  The  secant  through  {a^ftai),  {c^-Ay-^,  ^^ny  two  points on  the  conic,  and  the  tangent  at  the  first  point  are  respectively,
Proof. — The  first  is  a  right  line,  and  it  is  satisfied  by  a  =  Oi,  &c.,  and also  by  a  =  cu,  &c.,  by  (4725).  The  second  equation  is  what  the  first  be- comes when  n'2  =  "i'  &c.     For  the  tangential  equation,  see  (4893).
4735  The  conic  is  a  parabola  when f^'-^m'h^-{-nH'-2mnht-2nUil-2lmnh  =  0,
4736  or  y(/a)  +  v/0Hl))+y(»a)  =  O.
Proof. — Substitute  the  coordinates  of  the  centre  (4733)  in  aa  +  6/3  +  Cy  =  0, the  equation  of  the  line  at  infinity  (4612).
Otherwise,  the  conic  must  touch  the  line  at  infinity ;  therefore  put  a,  b,  C for  A,  ^i,  r  in  (4893).
4737  The  conic  is  a  rectangular  hyperbola  when
/  cos  J  +  m  cos  B-\-ii  cos  C  =  0,
and  in  this   case  it  passes  through  the  orthocentre  of  the triangle.

Proof. — (Fig.  50.)     The  first  equation  may  be  written ny  (ny-2la-2mi3)  +  (la-r>i(3y  =  0. By  (4699)  this  represents  a  conic  of  which  the  lines  y  and  ny  —  2la  —  mft  are the  tangents  at  F  and  /,  and  la  —  m^  the  chord  of  contact.     Similarly,  it  may be  written  so  as  to  shew  that  a  and  /5  touch  the  conic.

and  they  have  their  three  points  of  intersection  P,  Q,  B  on the  right  line   /a  +  mjS  +  ^iy.  By  (4604).
4742  The  coordinates  of  the  centre  of  the  conic  are  as
nh-\-mC  :  ZC+wcl  :  ?/ia+/I).
Proof. — By  putting  a  and  ft  =  zero  alternately  in  (4739),  we  find,  for the  coordinates  of  the  points  of  contact,
at  D,  /3  =  -i^^',     and  at  E,  a  =    ^"^'^
nh  +  mi '  '  m\  +  h  '
therefore  the  equation  of  the  diameter  through  C  bisecting  DE  is,  by  (4603), a        ^       ft
Similarly  the  diameter  bisecting  DF  is
la  +  lb      7ib  +  mc
Therefore  the  point  of  intersection,  or  centre,  is  defined  by  the  ratios  given above.

Proof. — The  second  term  is  the  circumscribing  circle  (4738),  and  the first  is  linear  by  (4G()9)  ;  therefore  the  whole  represents  a  circle.  By  varying k,  a  system  of  circles  is  obtained  whose  radical  axis  (4161)  is  the  line la  +  mft  +  ny,  the  circumscribing  circle  being  one  of  the  system.

(a  cos  J.  4-/5  cosi)  +  y  cos  C)(a  sin  J.  +  /3  sin  i?  +  y  sin  G)]
—  2  (/3y  sin  A  +  ya  sin  B  +  afi  sin  C)  =  0. See  Proof  of  (4751).     Now,  when  a  =  0,  the  equation  becomes
(/3  sinS  — y  sin(7)(/3  cos5-y  cos  G)  =  0, whicli  shews,  by  (4631,  '3),  that  the  circle  bisects  BC  and  passes  through  D, the  foot  of  the  perpendicular  from  A.
4754«  The  equation  of  tlie  nine-point  circle  in  Cartesian coordinates,  with  the  side  BC  and  perpendicular  on  it  from  A for  X  and  y  axes  respectively,  is

point  of  any  side  to  the  mid-point  of  the  perpendicular  on  that through  S.
Proof.— Let  X,  Y,  Z  (Fig.  166)  be  the  feet  of  the  perpendiculars  ;  x,  y,  z the  mid-points  of  the  same,  and  X',  Y',  Z'  the  mid-points  of  the  sides.  Now the  trilinear  coordinates  of  X',  /S',  and  x  in  order  are  proportional  to
0,  c,  h  This   determinant   vanishes ; a,       h^         c         .     therefore  the  three  points  are  on
1,  cos  (7,  cos  I?  the  same  right  line,  by  (4015).
That  the  three  lines  X'x,  Y'y,  Z'z  are  concurrent  appears  at  once  by  (970), since  CX-  2Y'x,  &c.
The  Symmeclian  point  may  also  be  defined  as  the  intersec- tion of  the  three  lines  drawn  from  ^,  i?,  C  to  the  corresponding vertices  of  the  triangle  formed  by  tangents  to  the  circum- circle  at  A,  B,  G.
Let  Ba,  (7/3,  Ay  be  taken  =  CX,  AY,  BZ  respectively. Then  Aa,  B^,  Gy  meet  in  a  point  2,  by  (976),  and  this  point by  similarity  of  figure  is  the  Symmedian  point  of  the  triangle formed  by  lines  through  A,  B,  G  parallel  to  the  sides  BG, GA,  AB.
If  the  sides  of  X'Y'Z'  be  bisected,  similar  reasoning  shews that  a,  the  Symmedian  point  of  the  triangle  X'Y'Z',  lies on  S^.
It  can  also  be  shewn  that,  if  A'B'G'  be  any  triangle  having its  sides  parallel  to  those  of  xiBG  and  its  vertices  on  SA,  SB, 8G,  the  sides  of  the  two  triangles  intersect  in  six  points  on  a circle  whose  centre  lies  midway  between  the  circum-centres of  the  same  triangles.  When  A'B'G'  shrinks  to  the  point  Sy the  circle  becomes  the  T.  R.  circle.
A  more  general  theorem  respecting  the  triangle  and  circle is  the  following —
Take  ABG  any  triangle,  and  let  DD'EE'FF'  be  the  points  in  order,  in which  any  circle  cuts  the  sides.

CONIC  AND  SELF-CONJUGATE    TRIANGLE.
When  the  sides  of  the  trigon  are  the  polars  of  the  opposite vertices,  the  general  equation  of  the  conic  takes  the  form
4755  /V+m2)82-?iy  =  0.
Proof.  — (Fig.  51.)  The  equation  may  be  written  in  any  one  of  the three  ways,
/V  =  {ny-\-m(3){ny—m(3),  m^^^  =  (ny  +  la)(ny—la),
n^y^  =  {la  +  im^){la—imf3).
Hence,  by  (4699),  a  or  BG  is  the  chord  of  contact  of  the  tangents ny:hml3(AQ,  AS)  drawn  from  A,  and  ft  is  the  chord  of  contact  of  the tangents  ny  ±  la  (BR,  BP)  drawn  from  B.  Hence  a,  ft  are  the  polars  of  A,  B respectively  ;  and  therefore  y  or  AB  is  the  polar  of  G  (4130).  Also  y  may be  considered  to  be  the  chord  of  contact  of  the  imaginary  tangents  Za±im/3 drawn  from  G.
4756  If  the  points  of  intersection  of  a  and  j3  with  the  conic be  joined,  the  equations  of  the  sides  of  the  quadrilateral  so formed  are
QR,       Ia-\-mfi+ny  =  0,         SF,  la-\-mfi-ny  =  0,
PQ,   -^la-\-tnl3-{-ny  =  0,         RS,  la—m3-{-ny  =  0.
Hence  QB,  SP  and  PQ,  BS  intersect  on  the  line  y  in  A' and  B'.

4757  Eacli  pencil  of  four  lines  in  the  diagi^am  is  a  liarmonic pencil,  bjtlie  test  in  (4649).
4758  The  triangle  A'B'C  is  also  self- conjugate  with  regard to  the  conic.
Proof. — The  equations  of  its  sides  GB\  CA',  A'B'  are lu-mft  =  0,         Za  +  m/3  =  0,        y  =  0. Denote  these  by  a,  /3\  y,  and  put  a,  /8  in  (4755)   in  terms  of  a',  /S'.     The equation  referred  to  A'B  G  thus  becomes  a'^-|-)8'^— 2ft'y^  =  0,  which  is  of  the same  form  as  (4755).
4759  It  is  clear  that  the  triangles  AQS  and  BPB,  formed by  a  pair  of  tangents  and  the  chord  of  contact  in  each  case, are  also  self-conjugate.
4760  Taking  A'B'G  for  the  trigon,  and  denoting  the  sides by  a,  /3,  y,  the  equations  of  the  sides  R8,  PQ,  QB,  SB  of  the quadrilateral  become  respectively
ny  :^la=  0,  mfi  i  ny  =  0.
Ex. — As  an  example  of  (4611),  we  may  find  the  coordinates  of  P  from the  equations
aa  +  b/3  +  Cy  =  S  -s  C  "  ~  ^lm^(amn  +  hil  +  dm)
0  +  m(3 — ny  =  0  ^    from  which  < /S  =  '^mn-i-(amn+bnl  +  clm)
—  lu+  0   +ny  =  0)  ^7=    ^)il^(amn  +  hnl  +  clm).
To  obtain  the  coordinates  of  Q,  B,  and  S,  change  the  signs  of  m,  n,  and  I respectively.
ON  LINES  PASSING  THROUGH  IMAGINARY  POINTS.
4761  Lemma  I. — The  right  line  passing  through  two  con- jugate imaginary  points  is  real,  and  is  identical  with  the  line passing  through  the  points  obtained  by  substituting  unity  for ^/  —  \  in  the  given  coordinates.
Proof. — Let  {a  +  ia\  b  +  ib')  be  one  of  tlie  imaginary  points,  and  therefore (a  —  ia,  b — ib')  the  conjugate  point.  The  equation  of  the  line  passing  through them  is,  by  (4083)  and  reducing,  b'x  —  a'y  +  a'b  —  ab'  =  0,  which  is  real.
But  this  is  also  the  line  obtained  by  taking  for  the  coordinates  of  the points  (a  +  a'j  b  +  b')  and  (a— a',  b  —  b').
Lemma  II. — If  P,  S  and  Q,  B  are  two  pairs  of  conjugate imaginary  points,  the  lines  BS  and  QR  are  real,  as  has  just been  sliown,  and,  tliorefore,  also  their  point  of  intersection  is
SELF-CONJUGATE  TRIANGLE.  649
real.  The  otlier  pairs  of  lines  PQ,  BS  and  PR,  QS  are imaginary.  But  the  points  of  intersection  of  each  pair  are real,  and  are  identical  with  the  points  which  are  obtained  by substituting  unity  for  \/ —  1  in  the  given  coordinates,  and drawing  the  six  lines  accordingly.
Proof. — Let  the  coordinates  of  the  four  points  be  as  under —
P   a  +  ia,     h  +  ih',  Q   a  +  ia,     jj  +  ifl':
S   a  —  ia,     h  —  ih',  R   u—ia,     (o—ift'.
The  equations  of  PB  and  QS,  by  (4083),  are  L  +  iM  and  L—iM,  where
L  =  (b—p)    ,i'  —  (a  —  a)    y  +  a  jj  —  ah  +a'iy  —  a'b',
M=  (h'  +  i3')x—(a—a)^j  +  afi-ab  —  aiy  +cib'.
Now  the  Unas  L  :iz  iM  =  0  intersect  in  the  same  real  point  as  the  lines i  ±  ill  =  0,  because  the  values  L  =  0,  M  =  0  satisfy  both  equations simultaneously.  Hence,  to  determine  this  point,  we  have  only  to  take  i  as unity  in  the  given  coordinates.
Lemma  III. — If  P,  S  are  real  points,  and  Q,  B  sl  pair  of conjugate  imaginary  points,  the  lines  PS  and  QB  are  both real,  by  Lemma  I.,  and  consequently  their  point  of  intersec- tion is  real.  The  remaining  pairs  of  hues  PQ,  BS  and  PB,  QS and  their  points  of  intersection  are  all  imaginary.  But  the line  joining  these  two  imaginary  points  of  intersection  is  real, and  is  jdentical  with  the  line  obtained  by  substituting  unity for  \/  —  l  in  the  given  coordinates  and  drawing  the  six  lines accordingly.
Proof. — Let  the  coordinates  of  the  four  points  be  as  under —
P   x,ij„  Q   a  +  ia,     i8+//3',
S   x.2y,,  B   a  —  ia,     ft—ifi'.
Since  the  coordinates  of  B  are  obtained  from  those  of  Q  by  merely  changing the  sign  of  i,  the  equations  of  the  four  imaginary  lines  will  take  the  forms
PQ   A-iB,  SQ    C-iD,
PB   A  +  iB,  SB    C+iD.
Now  let  the  coordinates  of  the  point  of  intersection  of  PQ  and  SB  be L+iM,  L'  +  iM',  then  will  L — iM,  L'  —  iM'  be  the  coordinates  of  the  intersec- tion of  PB  and  SQ,  for  the  equations  of  this  pair  of  lines  are  got  from  those of  PQ  and  SB  by  merely  changing  the  sign  of  i.  The  points  of  intersection are  therefore  conjugate  imaginary  points,  and  the  line  joining  them  is  real, by  Lemma  I.  Also,  since  that  line  is  obtained  by  writing  1  for  i  in  the  co- ordinates of  those  points,  it  will  also  be  obtained  by  writing  1  for  i  in  the original  coordinates  of  Q  and  B  and  constructing  the  figure  as  before.

650  TBILINEAE  ANALYTICAL  CONICS.
4762  To  find  a  common  pole  and  polar  of  two  given  conies  : (i.)  If  the  conies  intersect  in  four  real  points  P,  Q,  R,  S,
construct  the  complete  quadrilateral  (4652).  Then  A'B'G (Fig.  51)  is  a  self-conjugate  triangle  for  each  conic,  by (4758),  and  therefore  each  vertex  and  the  opposite  side  form a  common  pole  and  polar  to  the  conies.
(ii.)  If  the  conies  do  not  intersect  at  all  in  real  points,  the triangle  A'B'G  is  still  real,  by  Lemma  II.  (4761),  and  can  be constructed  in  the  manner  shown.
(iii.)  If  two  of  the  points  (P,  S)  are  real,  and  two  {Q,  B) imaginary,  then,  by  Lemma  III.,  the  vertex  A'  and  the  side B'G  are  real,  and  may  be  constructed,  and  they  form  a  common pole  and  polar  of  the  given  conies.
Returning  to  the  triangle  of  reference  ABG,
4763  Let  la  =  ny  cos  (j>,  m(i=  ny  sm<p;  then  the  chord joining  two  points  <^i,  <^2  is
la  cosi  (<^i+(^2)+»^/3  sini  (<^i+<^2)  =  ny  cosj  (<^i  — (^o)^
and  therefore  the  tangent  at  the  point  <(>'  is
4764  loi  cos  ^'-\-mfi  sin  <f>  =  ny.
4765  Putting  V  =  L,  m'  =  M,  n''=-N,  the  conic  (4755) becomes
La:'JrMP'-\-Ny'  =  0   (1).
4766  The  tangent  or  polar  of  a(5'y'  is
Laa+Ml3fi'-\-Nyy'  =  0    (2).
4767  Hence  the  pole  of  \a-\-iJ,p-\-vy  —  i)

4768  The  tangential  equation  is

and  this  is  the  condition  that  the  conic  (1)  may  be  touched by  the  four  lines
\a±fil3±vy  =  0.
SELF-CONJUGATE  TRIANGLE.  651
4769  In  like  manner,
La'^+M)8'^+iVy- =  0   (5)
is  tlie  condition  tliat  (1)  may  pass  through  the  four  points (a,   ±^\   ±y').
4770  The  locus  of  the  pole  of  the  line  Xa+^^+vy  with respect  to  such  conies  is
a  ^  /8   "^  r
Proof. — By  (3),  if  (a,  /3,  y)  be  the  pole,  "  =  y  &c.,  .-.  L  =  —,  in  (5), the  equation  of  condition.
4771  The  locus  of  the  pole  of  the  line   la-\-mB-\-ny,   with respect  to  the  conies  which  touch  the  four  hues  Xa  ±  /ti^  ±  vy
I         tn        n
Proof.— By  (3),  if  (a,  ft,  y)  be  the  pole,  «  =  y  &c.,  .*.  i  =  -,  &c.,  in (4),  the  equation  of  condition.
4772  The  locus  of  the  centre  of  the  conic  is  given  in  each case  (4770,  '1)  by  taking  the  line  at  infinity
asin  J.+j3  sin  5  +  7  sin  (7
for  the  fixed  line,  since  its  pole  is  the  centre.
4773  Thus  the  locus  of  the  centre  of  the  conic  passing through  the  four  points   (a±/8'±y')   is
a  ^  sin  A      ^"■^  sin  B      y'~  sin  C  _  q ~^       +^i8~~+       y
4774  The  coordinates  of  the  centre  of  the  conic   (1)  are
,  La        M^        Ny
given  by  __  =  _^  :=  —Z-
Proof. — Let  the  conic  cut  the  side  a  in  the  points  (0^i7i),  (O/S.^y.^.  The right  line  from  A  bisecting  the  chord  will  pass  through  the  centre  of  the conic,  and  its  equation  will  he  ft  :  y  =  (3^  +  ^.2  :  yi  +  y.2-  Now  A  +  A  is  the sum  of  the  roots  of  the  quadratic  in  y8  obtained  by  eliminating  y  and  a  from the  equations  La' +  Mft^  +  Ny^  =  0,  a  =  0,  and  aa  +  hft  +  Cy  =  2.  Similarly for  yi  +  y2  eliminate  a  and  /3.  The  equation  of  the  diameter  thi'ough  A  being found,  those  through  B  and  G  are  symmetrical  with  it.

4776  The  condition  that  (1)  may  be  a  rectangular  hyperbola is  L-\-M-\-N  =  i),  and  in  this  case  the  curve  passes  through the  centres  of  the  inscribed  and  escribed  circles  of  the  trigon.
Proof. — By  (4G90),  (a,  b,  c  are  now  L,  M,  N).     (1)  is  now  satisfied  by a  :=  ±/3  =  ±y,  the  four  centres  in  question.

CARNOT'S  THEOREM.
4778  If  J,  B,  G  (Fig.  52)  are  the  angles  of  a  triangle,  and if  the  opposite  sides  intersect  a  conic  in  the  pairs  of  points a,  a  ;  h,  h'  -,  c,  c  ;  then

THEOREMS.  653
4780  The  reciprocal  of  Carnot's  theorem  is  :  If  A,  B,  G (Fig.  52)  are  the  sides  of  a  triangle,  and  if  pairs  of  tangents from  the  opposite  angles  are  a,  a' ;   h,  h' ;  c,  c' ;  then
sin  (Ac)  sin  (Ac)  sin  (Ba)  sin  (Ba)  sin  (Cb)  sin  {Cb')
=  sin  (Ab)  sin  (Ab')  sin  (Be)  sin  (Be)  sin  (Cm)  sin  (Ca),
where  (Ac)  signifies  the  angle  between  the  lines  A  and  c.
Proof. — Reciprocating  the  former  figure  with  respect  to  any  origin  0, let  A,  B,  G  (i.e.,  BQ,  QP,  PB)  be  the  polars  of  the  vertices  A,  B,  C.  Then, by  (4130),  Q,  B  will  be  the  poles  of  AB,  AG;  and  b,  h',  the  polars  of  the points  h,  V,  will  intersect  in  B  and  touch  the  reciprocal  conic.  Similarly,  c,  c' will  intersect  in  Q.  A,  h'  are  perpendicular  to  OA,  Oh',  and  therefore /.Ah'=  Z  AOh',  and  so  of  the  rest.
PASCAL'S  THEOREM.
4781  The  opposite  sides  of  a  hexagon  inscribed  to  a  conic meet  in  three  points  on  the  same  right  line.
Proof. — (Fig.  53.)  Let  a,  ft,  y,  y',  ft',  a  be  the  consecutive  sides  of  the hexagon,  and  let  u  be  the  diagonal  joining  the  points  au  and  yy'.  The equation  of  the  conic  is  either  ay  — Jcftu  =  0  or  a'y'—k'ft'u  =  0,  and,  since these  expressions  vanish  for  all  points  on  the  curve,  we  must  have  ay  —  l-ftu =  ay'  —  k'ft'to  for  miy  values  of  the  coordinates.  Therefore  oy  — a'y' =  li  (hft  —  k'ft').  Therefore  the  lines  a,  a'  and  also  y,  y' meet  on  tlie  line kft  —  k'ft';  and  ft,  ft'  evidently  meet  on  that  line.
Otherwise,  by  projecting  a  hexagon  inscribed  in  a  circle  with  its  opposite sides  parallel  upon  any  plane  not  parallel  to  that  of  the  circle.  The  line  at infinity,  in  which  the  pairs  of  parallel  sides  meet,  becomes  a  line  in  which the  corresponding  sides  of  a  hexagon  inscribed  in  a  conic  meet  at  a  finite distance  (1075  et  seq.).
4782  With  the  same  vertices  there  are  sixty  different hexagons  inscribable  in  any  conic,  and  therefore  sixty  dif- ferent Pascal  lines  corresponding  to  any  six  points  on  a  conic.
Proof. — Half  the  number  of  ways  of  taking  in  order  five  vertices  B,  G, D,  E,  F  after  A  is  the  number  of  different  hexagons  that  can  be  drawn,  and the  demonstration  in  (4781)  applies  equally  to  all.
BRIANCHON'S  THEOREM.
4783     The  three  diagonals  of  a  hexagon  circumscribed  to  a conic  pass  through  the  same  point  (Fig.  54).
664  TBILINEAR  ANALYTICAL  GONIOS.
Proof.— Let  the  three  conies  /S  +  L\  S  +  M\  S  +  N\  in  (4707),  become three  pairs  of  right  lines,  then  the  three  lines  L—M,  M—N,  N—L  become the  diagonals  of  a  circumscribing  hexagon.
Pascal's  and  Brianchon's  theorems  may  be  obtained,  the  one  from  the other,  by  reciprocation  (48-40).
THE  CONIC  REFERRED  TO  TWO  TANGENTS  AND THE   CHORD  OF  CONTACT.
Let  L  =  0,  M=0,  B  =  0  (Fig.  55)  be  the  sides  of  the trigon ;  L,  M  being  tangents  and  B  the  chord  of  contact.
4784  The  equation  of  the  conic  is    LM  =  R\  (4G99)
4785  The  lines  AP,  BP,  and  GP  are  respectively
IlL  =  R,  iiR=  M,  irL  =  M.       [By  (4604).
Since  the  point  P  on  the  curve  is  determined  by  the  value of  ^5  it  is  convenient  to  call  it  the  point  /n.
4788  The  points  /i  and  —  ju  (P  and  Q)  are  both  on  the  line ju^Jv  =  M  drawn  through  G.
4789  The  secant  through  the  points  ^,  /x'  (P,  P'}  is
/m/x L-  (ft+fi)  R  +  M  =  0.
Proof.  —  Write  it  fi(fi'L  —  ]i)  —  (fi'Ii—M),  and,  by  (4604),  it  passes through  the  point  ^'.  Similarly  through  /j.  Otherwise,  determine  the  co- ordinates of  the  intei-section  of  ^L  —  B  and  f.ili~M,  and  of  {.I'L  —  U  and fx'B—M  by  (4610),  and  the  equation  of  the  secant  by  (4616).
4790  Cor. — The  tangents  at  the  points  /n  and  —  ^i  (P,  Q) are  therefore
4791  These  tangents  intersect  on  B.  [Proof  by  subtraction.
4792  Theorem. — If  the  equation  of  a  right  line  contains  an indeterminate  ^  in  the  second  degree,  it  may  be  written  as above,  and  the  line  must  therefore  touch  the  conic  LM=  R^.
4793  The  ])olar  of  the  point  (//,  M\  B')  is
LM'-2RR-\-L'M  =  {).
TEE  come  LM  =  Rl  655
Proof. — For  /i  +  ju'  and  ju^',  in  (4789),  put  the  values  of  the  sum  and product  of  the  roots  of  /li'^L' -2fiB' +  31'  =  0  (4790).
4794  Similarly  the  polar  of  the  point  of  intersection  of aL  —  B  and  bB  —  M  is
abL-2aR-^M=0.
4795  The  line  GE  joining  the  vertex  G  to  the  intersection of  two  tangents  at  ^t  and  /.i,  or  at  —/n  and  —jn',  is
iHLL—M=  0.
Otherwise,  if  two  tangents  meet  on  any  line  ciL  —  M,  drawn through  G,  the  product  of  their  ^u's  is  equal  to  a.
Proof. — Eliminate  R  from  the  equations  of  the  two  tangents  (4790).
4796  The  chords  PQ,  FQ  and  the  line  GE  all  intersect  in the  same  point  on  B.
Proof.— The  equations  of  FQ',  P'Q  are,  by  (4789), l^fi'L±  d-i-i-i')  E-M  =  0, and,  by  addition  and  subtraction,  we  obtain  fxfx'L  —  M  =  0  (4795),  or  i?- =  0.
4797  The  lines  i^fx'L  +  M  (GD)  and  B  intersect  on  the  chord PP'  which  joins  the  points  jn,  ^t/;  or — The  extremities  of  any chord  passing  through  the  intersection  of  aL-\-M  and  B  have the  product  of  their  ^'s  equal  to  a.
4798  The  chord  joining  the  points  ^i  tan  ^,  /i  cot  ^  touches  a conic  having  the  same  tangents  L,  M  and  chord  of  contact  B.
Proof. — The  equation  of  the  chord  is,  by  (4789), fi^L— fiE  (tan  (l)  +  coi<p)  +  M=  0, and  this  touches  the  conic  JyMsin^2^  =  jB^  at  the  point  yu,  by  (4792).

4802  Ex.  3. — To  inscribe  a  ti-iangle  in  a  conic  so  that  its  sides  may  pass through  three  fixed  points.     (See  also  4823.)
We  have  to  make  the  base  ahL+ (a  +  h)  ixB  +  in^M  (4801)  pass  through a  third  fixed  point.  Let  this  point  be  given  by  cL  =  P,  dB  =  M.  Elimi- nating L,  M,  B,  we  get  ab  +  (a  +  b)  ixc  +  fx'^cd  =  0,  and  since,  at  the  point  /u, nL  =  B,  fj}L  =  M,  that  point  must  be  on  the  line  abL  +  (a-\-b)  cB  +  cdM. The  intersections  of  this  line  with  the  conic  give  two  solutions  by  two  posi- tions of  the  vertex.  [^Ibid.

ANHARMONIC   PENCILS    OF   CONICS.
4809     The  anharmonic  ratio  of  the  pencil  drawn  from  any point  on  a  conic  through  four  fixed  points  upon  it  is  constant.
Proof. — Let  the  vertices  of  the  quadrilateral  in  Fig.  (38)  be  denoted  by A,  B,  C,  I),  and  let  P  be  the  fifth  point.  Multiplying  the  equation  of  the conic  (4697)  by  the  constants  AB,  CD,  BC,  DA,  we  have

the  anliarmonic  ratio  of  tlie  pencil  is,  by  (4G50),
4811  CoE.  1. — If  four  lines  through  any  point,  taken  for the  vertex  LM,  meet  the  conic  in  the  points  ^tj,  /n.,,  fx-s,  /t^,  the anharmonic  ratio  of  these  points,  with  any  fifth  point  on  the conic,  is  equal  to  that  of  the  points  —/Hi,  —  a'o,  — /"s,  —l^a  i^ which  the  same  lines  again  meet  the  conic.
4812  CoE.  2.  —  The  reciprocal  theorem  is — If  from  four points  upon  any  right  line  four  tangents  be  drawn  to  a  conic, the  anharmonic  ratio  of  the  points  of  section  with  any  fifth tangent  is  equal  to  the  corresponding  ratio  for  the  other  four tangents  from  the  same  points.
4813  The  anharmonic  ratio  of  the  segments  of  any  tangent to  a  conic  made  by  four  fixed  tangents  is  constant.
Proof. — Let  fx,  n^,  fj^,  yug,  fx^  (Fig.  60)  be  the  points  of  contact.  The anliarmonic  ratio  of  the  segments  is  the  same  as  that  of  the  pencil  of  four lines  from  LM  to  the  points  of  section;  that  is,  of  nn^L—M,  iiii.Jj  —  M, HH-Jj—M,  fifi^L-  M,  a  pencil  homographic  (4651)  with  that  in  (481U).
4814  If  P,  P'  are  the  polars  of  a  point  with  respect  to  the conies  8,  S\  then  P-\-hP'  will  be  the  polar  of  the  same  point with  respect  to  the  conic  S-\-h8'.
4815  Hence  the  polar  of  a  given  point  with  regard  to  a conic  passing  through  four  given  points  (the  intersections  of 8  and  8')  always  passes  through  a  fixed  point,  by  (4101).
If  Q,  Q'  are  the  polars  of  another  point  with  respect  to the  same  conies,  Q-\-hQ  is  the  polar  with  respect  to  8-\-h8'.
4816  Hence  the  polars  of  two  points  with  regard  to  a system  of  conies  through  four  points  form  two  homographic pencils  (4651).
4817  The  locus  of  intersections  of  corresponding  lines  of two  homographic  pencils  ha^ang  fixed  vertices  (Fig.  61)  is  a conic  passing  through  the  vertices ;  and,  conversely,  if  the conic  be  given,  the  pencils  will  be  homographic.
Proof.— For  climinatiiio-  A- fnmi  P  +  AT'=  0,  Q  +  IQV,  we  get  !'(/=  r'Q-

4818  Cor. — The  locus  of  the  pole  of  the  line  joining  the  two points  in  (4816)  is  a  conic.
PROOr. — For  the  pole  is  the  intersection  of  P  +  hP'  and  Q  +  hQ'.
4819  The  right  lines  joining  corresponding  points  AA',  &c. (Fig.  62)  of  two  homographic  systems  of  points  lying  on  two right  lines,  envelope  a  conic.
Proof. — This  is  the  reciprocal  theorem  to  (4817)  ;  or  it  follows  from (4813).
4820  If  two  conies  have  double  contact  (Fig.  63),  the  an- harmonic  ratio  of  the  points  of  contact  A,  B,  G,  D  of  any four  tangents  to  the  inner  conic  is  the  same  as  that  of  each set  of  four  points  (a,  b,  c,  d)  or  {a,  h\  c',  <V)  in  which  the tangents  meet  the  other  conic.
Proof. — By  (4798).  The  ^'s  for  the  points  on  the  latter  conic  will  be equal  to  the  /.t's  of  the  points  of  contact  multiplied  by  tan  <p  for  one  set,  and by  cot^)  for  the  other,  and  therefore  the  ratio  (4810)  will  be  unaltered.
4821  Conversely,  if  three  chords  of  a  conic  aa  ,  hb',  cc  be fixed,  and  a  fourth  rZc?' moves  so  that  \ahcd\  =  [ctb'c'd'l,  then dd'  envelopes  a  conic  having  double  contact  with  the  given one.
For  theorems  on  a  right  line  cut  in  involution  by  a  conic,  see  (4824-8).

4822  If  a  polygon  inscribed  to  a  conic  (Fig.  64)  has  all  its sides  but  one  passing  through  fixed  points  A,  B,  ...  Y,  the remaining  side  az  will  envelope  a  conic  having  double  contact with  the  given  one.
Proof. — Let  a,h,  ...z  be  the  vertices  of  the  polygon,  and  a,  a',  a",  a'" four  successive  positions  of  a.     Then,  by  (4811),
I  a,  a,  a",  a"  }  =  {  ^j  ^' ■>  ^"  ■>  ^"'  |  =  &c.  =  |  2;, Therefore,  by  (4821),  the  side  az  envelopes  a  conic,  &c.
660  TBILINEAB  ANALYTICAL  CONIGS.
4823  Poncelet's  construction  for  inscribing  in  a  conic  a polygon  having  its  n  sides  passing  through  n  given  points.
Inscribe  three  polygons,  each  0/  n  +  1  sides,  so  that  n  of each  may  pass  through  the  fixed  points,  and  let  the  remaining sides  he  a'z',  af'z",  ?\1"t:!" ,  denoted  in  figure  (65)  hy  AD,  CF,  EB. Jjet  MLN,  tlie  line  joining  the  intersections  of  opposite  sides  of the  hexagon  ABCDEF  (4781),  meet  the  conic  in  K;  then  K will  be  a  vertex  of  the  required  polygon.
Proof. —  iD.KAGIj]  =  iA.KDFB\,  each  pencil  passing  through K,  P,  N,  L;  therefore  the  anharmonic  ratio  |  KAGE  ]  =  \  KDFB  \  for  any vertex  on  the  conic,  by  (4809)  ;  i.e.,  I  Kaa'a"  \  =  |  Kz'z"z"'  \  .  But,  if  az be  the  remaining  side  of  a  fourth  polygon  inscribed  like  the  others,  we  have by  (4811),  as  in  (4822),  |  aa'a'a"  \  =  i  zz'z'z"  | .  Hence  K  is  the  point where  a  and  z  coincide.
4824  Lemma. — A  system  of  conies  passing  through  four fixed  points  meets  any  transversal  in  a  system  of  points  in involution  (1066).
Proof. — Let  u,  u  be  two  conies  passing  through  the  four  points  ;  then u-\-'kitj'  will  be  any  other.  Take  the  transversal  for  x  axis,  and  put  ?/  =  0  in each  conic,  and  let  their  equations  thus  become  ax-  +  2qx  +  c  =  0  and aV  +  2(7'a)+c'  =  0.  These  determine  the  points  where  the  transversal meets  u  and  u .  It  will  then  meet  u  +  Jcu'  in  two  points  given  by ax^  +  2gx  +  c  +  k  (a V  +  2g'x  +  c')  =  0,  and  these  points  arc  in  involution  with the  former,  by  (1065).
Geometrically  (Fig.  QQ),
[a.AdhA']  =  [c.AdbA']    (4809),
therefore    { AGBA'  ]  =  { AB'G'A' }  =  { A'G'B'A  } ,  therefore  by  (1069).
4825  Cor.  1. — One  of  the  conies  of  the  system  resolves itself  into  the  two  diagonals  ac,  bd.  Hence  the  points  B,  B\ G,  G'  are  in  involution  with  D,  D' ,  where  the  transversal  cuts the  diagonals.
4826  CoR.  2. — A  transversal  meets  a  conic  and  two  tan- gents in  four  points  in  involution,  so  as  to  meet  the  chord  of contact  in  one  of  the  foci  of  the  system.
For,  in  (Fig.  66),  if  h  coincides  with  c,  and  a  with  d,  the transversal  meets  the  tangents  in  G,  G',  while  B,  B\  D,  B',  all coincide  in  F  (Fig.  Ql),  one  of  the  foci  on  the  chord  of contact.

where  A^,  H^,  i?i  belong  to  the  first  conic  and  have  the  values in  (4988).
Peoof. — The  quadratic  A.^x-  +  2IIx7j  +  B^y-  =  0,  obtained  in  (4987),  deter- mines the  pair  of  points  of  intersection  with  the  first  conic.  The  similar equation  for  the  third  conic  will  have  A^  =  A-^  +  XAi,  &c.,  if  the  points  are all  in  involution  (1065).  The  third  equation  is  therefore  derived  from  the other  two;  therefore  the  determinant  vanishes,  by  (583).
By  expanding  and  dividing  by  p^,  the  second  determinant  above  of  the sixth  order  is  obtained.
Newton's  Method  of  Generating  a  Conic.
4829  Two  constant  angles  aPb,  aQh  (Fig.  68)  move  about fixed  vertices  P,  Q.  If  a  moves  on  a  fixed  right  line,  h  de- scribes a  conic  which  passes  through  P  and  Q.
Proof. — Taking  four  positions  of  a,  we  have  (see  1054),
{P.hbV'h'"}  =  {P.aa'a'a'"]  =  {Q.aaa'a"}  =  {Q.hl'h"h"']  . Therefore,  by  (4817),  the  locus  of  6  is  a  conic.

Proof. — The  pencils  of  lines  through  ^4  and  B  in  tbe  figure  are  both homogi'aphic  with  the  pencil  through  C,  and  are  therefore  homographic  with each  other.     Therefore  the  locus  of  F  is  a  conic,  by  (4817).

4835  To    describe  a   conic,    given   three   points    and   two tangents.
Let  A,  A',  A''  he  the  points  {Fig.  67,  supplying  obvious letters).  Let  the  two  tangents  meet  AA'  in  the  points  C,  C. Find  F,  F',  the  foci  of  the  system  AA\  CC  in  involution  (1066) determining  the  centre  by  (985).  Similarly,  find  Gr,  G',  the foci  of  a  system  on  the  line  KK".  Then,  by  (4826),  the  chord of  contact  of  the  tangents  may  be  any  of  the  lines  FG,  FG', F'G,  F'G'.  There  are  accordingly  four  solutions,  and  the construction  of  (4831)  determines  the  conic.
4836  To   describe   a   conic,  given    two   points    and   three tangents.
Let  AB,  BO,  CA  {Fig.  167)  be  the  tangents,  and  P,  P'  the points.  Draw  a  transversal  through  PP'  meeting  the  three tangents  in  Q,  Q',  Q".  Find  F,  a  focus  of  the  system  PP',  QQ' in  involution  (1066,  985) ;  G  a  focus  for  PF,  qq',and  H/or PP',  Q'Q''.  Cunstruct  a  triangle  luith  its  sides  passing  through F,  G,  H,  ami  ivith  its  vertices  L,  M,  N  on  BC,  CA,  AB, by  the  method  of  (4823),  lohich  is  equally  applicable  to  a  recti- lineal figure  as  to  a  conic.  L,  M,  N  will  be  the  points  of contact.  The  reason  for  the  construction  is  contained  in (4826).     There  will,  in  general,  be  four  solutions.
If  the  conic  be  a  parabola,  the  foregoing  constructions can  be  adapted  by  considering  one  tangent  at  infinity  always to  be  given.
4837     To  draw  a  parabola  through  four  given  points  a,  a,  b,  b' .
This  is  problem  4833  with  the  tangent  at  infinity.
In  figure  (52),  suppose  cc  to  coincide  and  AB  to  remove  to  infinity  so  as to  become  the  tangent  at  c,  the  opposite  vertex  at  infinity  of  a  parabola,  and therefore  to  be  perpendicular  to  the  axis.      Cc  then  becomes  a  diameter  of the  parabola,  and  Caruot's  theorem  (4778)  shows  that Ca.Ga   ^4^Ba^^  sin' AGc Gb.Cb'       AV'' Bo''       sin' BGc since  the  points  C,  a,  a,  h,  V  are  all  on  the  axis  of  the  parabola  relatively  to the  infinite  distance  oi  AcB.     This  result,  however,  is  at  once  obtained  from equation  (4221),  Ga.Ca   :  Cb .  Gb'  being  the  ratio  of  the  products  of  the  roots of  two  similar  quadratics.     Thus  a  diameter  of  the  parabola  can  be  drawn through  C  by  the  known  ratio  of  the  sines  of  AGc  and  BCc.
Next,  describe  a  circle  round  three  of  the  given  points  a,  a',  b.  By  the property  (1263)  and  the  known  direction  of  the  axis,  the  other  point  in which  the  circle  cuts  the  parabola  can  be  found.
Five  points  being  known,  we  can,  by  Pascal's  theorem,  as  in  (4831),
664  TEILIKEAR  ANALYTICAL  CONICS.
obtain  two  parallel  cliovds,  and  tben  find  P,  the  extremity  of  tlieir  diameter, by  the  proportion,  square  of  ordinate  cc  abscissa  (1239).
Lastly,  draw  the  diameter  and  tangent  at  P,  and  then,  by  equality  of angles  (1224),  draw  a  line  from  P  which  passes  through  the  focus.  By obtaining  in  the  same  way  another  pair  of  parallel  chords,  a  second  line through  the  focus  is  found,  thus  determining  its  position.
4838  To  draw  a  parabola  when  four  tangents  are  given. This  is  effected  by  the  construction  of  (4832,  Fig.  71).    Let  AB,  BC,  AE,
ED  be  the  four  tangents,  and  CD  the  tangent  at  infinity.     Then  any  line drawn  to  C  will  be  parallel  to  BC,  and  any  line  to  D  will  be  parallel  to  ED.
4839  To    draw    a   parabola,   given   tliree    points    and   one tangent.
This  is  effected  by  the  construction  of  (4835,  Fig.  67).  Let  hC  be  the tangent  at  oo  ;  then  the  centre  of  involution  0  must  be  at  C,  so  that CC.CC  =  0. CO  =  CA.CA'  =  CF-,  determining  F.

4840  To    draw   a   parabola,    given   one   point    and    tliree tangents.
This  is  the  case  of  (4834),  in  which  one  of  the  given  tangents  h'  is  at infinity.  B  must  therefore  be  at  infinity,  and  QB,  FB  and  the  tangent  h, since  they  all  join  it  to  finite  points,  must  be  parallel.  The  ratio  found determines  another  tangent,  and  the  case  is  reduced  to  that  of  (4838).
4841  To    draw   a   parabola,    given    two   points    and    two tangents.
This  is  problem  (4836).  Suppose  AC  in  that  construction  to  be  the tangent  at  infinity.  F,  G,  H  will  be  determined  as  in  (4830)  by  mean proportionals.  The  chords  LM,  NM  will  become  parallel,  since  M  is  at infinity;  and  we  have  to  draw  LA'' and  the  parallel  lines  from  L  and  N  to pass  through  F,  G,  H  in  their  new  positions,  so  that  the  vertices  L,  N  may lie  on  BC  and  AB.
Otherwise  by  (4509),  the  intercepts  s  and  i  can  readily  be  found  from  the two  equations  furnished  by  the  given  points.

THE   METHOD   OF   RECIPROCAL   POLARS.
Def. — The  polar  reciprocal  of  a  curve  is  the  envelope  of the  polars  of  all  the  points  on  the  curve,  or  it  is  the  locus  of the  poles  of  all  tangents  to  the  curve,  taken  in  each  case with  respect  to  an  arbitrary  fixed  origin  and  circle  of  recipro- cation.
4844  Thus,  in  figure  (72),  to  the  points  P,  Q,  B  on  one curve  correspond  the  tangents  qr,  rp,  and  chord  of  contact  j^q on  the  reciprocal  curve ;  and  to  the  points  p,  q,  r  correspond the  tangents  QB,  BP,  and  chord  PQ.
The  angle  between  the  tangents  at  P  and  Q  is  evidently equal  to  the  angle  j^Oq,  since  Oj),  Oq,  Or  are  respectively  per- pendicular to  QB,  BP,  PQ.
4845  Theorem. — The  distance  of  a  point  from  a  line  is  to  its distance  from  the  origin  as  the  distance  of  the  pole  of  the  line from  the  polar  of  the  point  is  to  its  distance  from  the  origin.
Proof.— (Fig.  73.)  Take  0  for  origin  and  centre  of  auxiliary  circle,  FT the  polar  of  c,  pt  the  polar  of  C,  CP  perpendicular  on  polar  of  c,  cp  perpen- dicular  on  polar  of  G.     Then

4863  According  as  the  tangents  from  the  origin  to  a  conic  are reat  or  imaginary,  the  reciprocal  curve  is  an  hyperbola  or ellipse.

TANGENTIAL    COORDINATES.
4870  By  employing  these  coordinates,  theorems  which  are merely  the  reciprocals  of  those  already  deduced  in  trilinears may  he  proved  independently.  See  (4019)  for  a  description of  this  system.
The  following  proposition  serves  to  transform  by  recipro- cation the  whole  system  of  trilinear  coordinates  of  points  and equations  of  right  lines  and  curves,  into  tangential  coordinates of  right  lines  and  equations  of  points  and  curves.
THEOREM   OF  TRANSFORMATION.
4871  Griven  the  trilinear  equation  of  a  conic  (4656),  the tangential  equation  of  the  reciprocal  conic  in  terms  of  X,  fx,  v, the  perpendiculars  from  three  fixed  points  A\  B' ,  C  upon  the tangent  (Fig.  74)  will  be  as  follows,  0  being  the  origin  of reciprocation  and  0A\  OB',  OC  =p,  ^/,  r: —

Prook. — Let  a  =  0,  /3  =  0,  y  =  0  be  the  sides  of  the  original  trigon  ABC. The  poles  of  these  lines  will  be  A',  B',  C,  the  vertices  of  the  trigon  for  the reciprocal  curve.  Let  BS  be  the  polar  of  a  point  P  on  the  given  conic ; a,  /3,  y  the  perpendiculars  from  P  upon  BC,  GA,  AB  ;  i.e.,  the  trilinear  co- ordinates of  P.  Let  X,  n,  V  be  the  perpendiculars  from  A',  B',  C  upon  BS; i.e.,  the  tangential  coordinates  of  the  p6lar  of  P  referred  to  A',  B',  C.     Then,
by  (484.5),  ^  =  ^^„  A=^,,  -r  =  ^.  Substitute  those  values of  a,  ft,  y  in  (4656)  and  divide  by  0P\
4873  The  angular  relation  between  the  trigons  ABG  and A'B'C  is
JiVCr  =  TT-A,     evil'  =  iT-B,     A'OB'  =  TT-C,
TANGENTIAL  G00BDINATE8.  669
4874  If  ^BG  be  self-conjugate  with  regard  to  tlie  circle  of reciprocation,  it  will  coincide  with  A'B'C.
4875  Now  let  0  be  the  circum-centre  (4629)  of  A'B'G' (Fig.  74),  then  it  will  be  the  in-centre  of  ABC,  and,  by  (4873),
2A'='n-A,     2B'=n-B,     2C'=7r-C.
Also  p  =  q  =  r  in  (4872),  which  becomes  ^  (X,  fi,  v)  =  0,  so that  the  conic  and  its  reciprocal  are  represented  by  the  satiie equation.  Consequently  any  relation  in  trilinear  coordinates has  its  interpretation  in  tangential  coordinates.  We  have then  the  following  rule  : —
4876  Rule. — To  convert  any  expression  in  trllinears  into tangentials,  consider  the  origin  of  the  former  as  the  in-centre  of the  trigon,  change  a,  |3,  y  into  X,  ^,  v,  and  interpret  the  result by  the  rules  for  reciprocating  (4846-65).  If  the  angles  of  the original  trigon  are  involved,  change  these  by  (4875)  into  the angles  of  the  reciprocal  trigon,  of  luhich  the  origin  ivill  now  be the  circum-centre.
4877  Referring  trihnears  and  tangentials  to  the  same  trigon ABC,  the  equation  of  a  point,  as  shown  in  (4021),  becomes

Proof. — The   trilinear  cooi'dinates   of  the  origin   and  centre    of  the  re- ciprocal conic  are  o  =  /3  =  y,   (4876).     It  is  also  self-evident.
4899  The  point   IX -{- m/LL -{- uv  =  0  will  be  at  infinity  when

Proof. — By  (4876),  for  the  line  la  +  mft  +  ny  =  0  will  pass  through  the origin  a  =  /3=:y  when  l  +  m  +  n:=0.
4900  A  curve  will  be  touched  by  the  line  at  infinity  when the  sum  of  the  coefficients  vanishes.
Proof.— By  (4876),  for  this  is  the  condition  that  the  origin  in  trilinears, a  =  /3  =  y  shall  be  on.  the  curve.
4901  The  equation  of  the  centre  of  the  conic  (p  (X,  ^t,  v)  is

Proof.— The  coordinates  of  the  in-centre  of  ABC  (4876)  are  a=fi'=y\ therefore  the  polar  of  this  point  with  regard  to  the  conic  f  (o,  ft,  y)  is 0^  +  ^  _1_,^  =0  (4658).  This  point  and  polar  reciprocate  into  a  polar  and point,  of  which  the  former,  being  the  reciprocal  of  the  in-centre,  or  origin,  is the  line  at  infinity,  and  therefore  the  latter  is  the  centre  of  <p  (X,  u,  y),  while its  equation  is  as  stated.

4903     The  equation   of  the  two  points  in   which  the  line (X',  /Li,  v)  cuts  the  conic  is
<l>  (V,  im\  y')  <f>  (X,  II,  v)  =  ((^^V+<^,,x'+</,,v7-.         (4680)
4904  The  coordinates  of  the  asymptotes  are  found  from  the equations
(l>  {\,  fjL,  v)  =  0     and     <^a  +  <^m+<^''=  0.
Proof. — These  are  the  conditions  that  the  line  (A,  /x,  j-)  should  touch  the curve  and  also  pass  through  the  centre  (4901).
4905  The  equation  of  the  two  circular  points  at  infinity  is
a^(X-^)(x-v)+lj^(^-v)(^~x)+cHv-x)(v-ft)  =  0.
Proof. — Put  X'=  ii'=  v'  in  (4903)  to  make  the  line  at  infinity,  and  for the  conic  take  the  in-circle  (4889).
4906  The  general  equation  of  a  circle  is
a^  (x-^)(x-v)+I)'^  {i,-v){i.-\)^e  {v-\){v-ix)
=  {lX-\-mix-^nvy   (1),
where  l\-\-m^i-^nv  =  0  is  the  equation  of  the  centre.
Proof. — The  general  equation  of  a  conic  in  trilinears  may,  by  (4601),  be put  in  the  form
a(/3-/3o)(y-yo)  +  K7-yo)(«-«o)+c(«-"o)(/5-/5o)  =  {la  +  mr^  +  ny)\ where   la  +  m/3  +  Ky  =  0  is  the  directrix,  and  ao/3oyo  the  focus.     Now  let  the focus  be  the  in-centre  of  the  trigon,  and  therefore  a„  =  /3o=yo=  |SS~^  (709). By  this  relation  and   aa  +  6^  +  cy  =  2,  the  equation  is  expressed  as
a(S-a)(a-/S)(«-y)  +  &c.  =  (Z'a+w'/3  +  7t'y)-, or  (a— /3)(a— y)  cos"  |^'1  +  &C.  =  (ra  +  m'/i +«'y)''
Reciprocating  by  (4876),  this  becomes
(\—fx)(X  —  v)  ain-  A' -\- &.C.  =  (Z\+ "'A' +«»')',
the  constant  factor  introduced  on  the  right  being  involved  in  I,  m,  n;  and sin7i'  =  cos-j^,  by  (4875).  And  we  know  that  this  is  a  cii'cle  by  (4845 Cor.),  and  that  the  directrix  of  the  conic  reciprocates  into  the  centre  of  the circle.
Otherwise. — The  left  side  of  (1)  represents  the  two  circular  points  at infinity  (4905),  and,  if  for  the  right  we  take  the  equation  of  a  point,  the whole  represents  a  conic,  as  in  (49(»9),  of  the  form  AC  =  B'-.  In  this  case, A,  C,  the  points  of  contact  of  tangents  from  B,  being  the  circular  points,  the conic  must  be  a  circle  with  i'  =  0  for  its  centre.

4907  Let  ^  =  0,  B  =  0,  G  =  0,  D  =  0  (Fig.  75)  be  the tangential  equations  of  the  four  points  of  a  quadrangle,  where A  =  a^X-\-hiiii-\-Ci^v,  B  =  a.2\-\-biiii-\-C2v,  and  so  on.  Then the  equation  of  the  inscribed  conic  will  be  AG  =  hBD.
Proof. — The  equation  is  of  the  second  degree  in  \,  ju,  v;  therefore  the line  (\,  /J.,  J')  touches  a  conic.  The  coordinates  of  one  line  that  touches  this conic  are  determined  by  the  equations  A  =  0,  B  =  0.  That  is,  the  line joining  the  two  points  A,  B  touches  the  conic,  and  so  of  the  rest.
4908  If  the  points  B,  D  coincide  (Fig.  76),  the  equation becomes  AG  =  JiB- ;  and  A  =  0,  G  =  0  are  the  points  of contact  of  tangents  from  the  point  B  =  0.
4909  Referring  the  conic  to  the  trigon  ABG  (Fig.  78),  and taking  AG  =  k^B^  for  its  equation,  let  a  tangent  ef  be  drawn, and  let  Ae  :  eB  =  h  :  m.  The  equations  of  the  points  f  and /  will  be
mA  +  hB  =  0,         mhB  +  6'  =  0.
Proof. — The  first  equation  corresponds  to  (4879).  For  the  equation  of/, eliminate  A  from  mA  +  kB  =  0  and  AG  —  Jc^B^-.
4910  Let  e,  h  (Fig.  77)  be  two  points  on  AB  whose  equa- tions are  mA-\-hB  =  0,  7iiA-\-kB  =  0.  The  equation  of  the point  jj,  in  which  tangents  from  e  and  h  intersect,  is
mmA-lr{m-\-m)  kB-^C  =  0.
Proof. — The  equation  may  be  put  in  the  form (mA  +  JcB)(mA  +  l-B)  =  0, because  k'^B'^=AG  if  the  line  touches  the  conic.  The  equation  being  of  the  first degree  in  A,  B,  G,  must  represent  some  point.  That  is,  the  relation  between A,  /.I,  V  involved  in  it  makes  the  stivaight  line  \a-\-i.ip-\-vy  pass  through  a certain  point.  But  the  equation  is  satisfied  when  mA  +  lcB  =  0,  a  relation which  makes  the  straight  line  pass  through  e.  Hence  a  tangent  through  e passes  through  a  certain  fixed  point.  Similarly,  by  '^n'A  +  A-Jj  =  0,  another tangent  passes  through  li  and  the  same  fixed  point.
4911  CoE. — Let  m  =  m,  then  the  equation  of  the  point  of contact  of  the  tangent  joining  the  points  ma  +  liB  and  ml'B-\-G (4909)  (e  and/,  Fig.  78)  will  be
m'A-\-2mkB-\rC  =  ().

4913  Note.— The  equation  f7  or  $  (A,  ^,  v)  =  0  (4G65)  expresses  the conditiou  that  Xa+fift  +  i^y  shall  touch  a  certain  conic.  When  U  is  about to  break  up  into  two  factors,  the  minor  axis  of  the  conic  diminishes  (Fig.  79). Every  tangent  that  can  now  be  drawn  to  the  conic  passes  very  nearly through  one  end  or  other  of  the  major  axis.  Ultimately,  when  the  minor axis  vanishes,  the  condition  of  the  line  touching  the  conic  becomes  the  con- dition of  its  passing  through  one  or  other  of  two  fixed  points  A,  B.  In  this case,  Z7  consists  of  two  factors,  which,  put  equal  to  zero,  are  the  equations of  those  points.  The  conic  has  become  a  straight  line,  and  this  line  is touched  at  every  point  by  a  single  tangent.
4914  If  TJ  and  V  (Fig.  80)  be  two  conies  in  tangential coordinates,  hJJ-[-TJ'  is  then  a  conic  having  for  a  tangent every  tangent  common  to  Z7  and  TJ' ;  and  kU-\-AB  is  a  conic having  in  common  with  U  the  two  pairs  of  tangents  drawn from  the  points  A,  B.
The  conic  U'  in  this  case  merges  into  the  line  AB,  or, more  strictly,  the  two  points  A,  B,  as  explained  in  (4913).
4915  If  either  hJJ^JJ'  or  hU+AB  breaks  np  into  two factors,  it  represents  two  points  which  are  the  opposite  ver- tices of  the  quadrilateral  formed  by  the  four  tangents.

INTRODUCTORY  THEOREM. Geometrical  meaning'  of  ^{  —  1).*
4916  In  a  system  of  rectangular  or  oblique  i)lanc  coordinates,  let  the operator  \/— I  prefixed  to  an  ordinate  ij  denote  the  turning  of  the  ordinate about  its  foot  as  a  centre  through  a  right  angle  in  a  plane  perpendicular  to the  plane  of  xy.     The  repetition  of  this   operation  will  turn  the  ordinate
*  [The  fiction  of  imaginary  lines  and  points  is  not  ineradicable  from  Geometry.  The theory  of  Quaternions  removes  all  imaginarincss  from  the  symbol  V -\,  and,  as  it  appears that  a  partial  application  of  that  theory  presents  the  subject  of  Projection  in  a  much  clearer light,  1  have  here  introduced  the  notion  of  the  multiplication  of  vectors  at  right  angles  to each  other.]

through  another  right  angle  in  the  same  plane  so  as  to  bring  it  again  into the  plane  o£  xy.  The  double  opei'ation  has  converted  y  into  —y.  But  the  two operations  are  indicated  algebraically  by  v  —  1  .  -s/  — 1  .y  or  (V  —lYy  =  —y, which  justifies  the  definition.
It  may  be  remarked,  in  passing,  that  any  operation  which,  being  per- formed twice  in  succession  upon  a  quantity,  changes  its  sign,  offers  a  con- sistent interpretation  of  the  multiplier  v/  — 1.
4917  With  this  additional  operator,  borrowed  from  the  Theory  of Quaternions,  equations  of  plane  curves  may  be  made  to  represent  more extended  loci  than  formerly.  Consider  the  equation  a^  +  y^=  dr.  For  values of  »  <  a,  we  have  y  =  zk  Va'—x^,  and  a  circle  is  traced  out.  For  values  of x>a,  we  may  write  y  =  ±i  \/x^  —  a^,  where  i  =  v/  — 1.  The  ordinate \/x'  —  c^  is  turned  through  a  right  angle  by  the  vector  i,  and  this  part  of  the locus  is  consequently  an  equilateral  hyperbola  having  a  common  axis  with the  circle  and  a  common  parameter,  but  having  its  plane  at  right  angles  to that  of  the  circle.  Since  the  foot  of  each  ordinate  remains  unaltered  in  posi- tion, we  may,  for  convenience,  leave  the  operation  indicated  by  i  unperformed and  draw  the  hyperbola  in  the  oi-iginal  plane.  In  such  a  case,  the  circle  may be  called  the  principal,  and  the  hyperbola  the  supplementary,  curve,  after Poncelet.  When  the  coordinate  axes  are  rectangular,  the  supplementary curve  is  not  altered  in  any  other  respect  than  in  that  of  position  by  the transformation  of  all  its  ordinates  through  a  right  angle  ;  but,  if  the  coordi- nate axes  are  obliqiie,  there  is  likewise  a  change  of  figure  precisely  the  same as  that  which  would  be  produced  by  setting  each  ordinate  at  right  angles  to its  abscissa  in  the  xy  plane.
In  the  diagrams,  the  supplementary  curve  will  be  shown  by  a  dotted  line, and  the  unperfoi'med  operation  indicated  by  i  must  always  be  borne  in  mind. For,  on  account  of  it,  there  can  be  no  geometrical  relations  between  the principal  and  supplementary  curves  excepting  those  which  arise  from  the possession  of  one  common  axis  of  coordinates.  This  law  is  in  agreement with  the  algebraic  one  which  applies  to  the  real  and  imaginary  parts  of  the equation  x^  —  (iyy  =  al     When  y  vanishes,  x  =  a  in  both  curves.
If  either  the  ellipse  b^x^  +  a-y'^  =  d-b-  or  the  hyperbola  b-x''  —  a-y'  =  d-b- be  taken  for  the  principal  curve,  the  other  will  be  the  supplementaiy  curve.
It  is  evident  that,  by  taking  diflTerent  conjugate  diameters  for  coordinate axes,  the  same  conic  will  have  corresponding  diflFerent  supplementary  curves. The  phrase,  "supplementary  conic  on  the  diameter  DD,"  for  example,  will refer  to  that  diameter  which  forms  the  common  axis  of  the  principal  and supplementary  conic  in  question.
4918  Let  us  now  take  the  circle  x~  +  y-  =  d^  and  the  right  line  x  =  h. When  &  is  >  a,  the  line  intersects  the  supplementary  right  hyperbola  in  two points  whose  ordinates  are  ±^'  v  &'  —  o.^.  By  increasing  b  without  limit,  we get  a  pair  of,  so-called,  imagiyiary  points  at  infinity.  These  lie  on  the asymptotes  of  the  hyperbola,  and  the  equation  of  the  asymptotes  is (^x  +  iy)(x-iy)  =  0.  _  _
We  can  now  give  a  geometrical  interpretation  to  the  statements  m  (4/'20). The  two  lines  drawn  from  the  focus  of  the  conic  b'-x'  +  a^y-  =  d'b''  to  the "  circular  points  at  infinity  "  make  angles  of  45°  with  the,  major  axis,  and they  touch  the  conic  in  its  supplementary  hyperbola  b'^x^—d'  {iy)-  =  d'lt\ An  independent  proof  of  this  is  as  follows.
Q1&  ANALYTICAL  GONICS.
Draw  a  tangent  from  S  (Fig.  81)  to  the  supplementary  liypei'bola,  and let  a;,  y  be  the  coordinates  of  the  point  of  contact  P.     Tiicii
^  =  ^,  (115^0)  =  _-f^;     and     >j  =  A  s/(^^-a^)  -  ^'
by  the  value  of  x.     Also
SN  =  x-CS=     ,^'f   ,..  -  y^F^'
Therefore    y  =  SN,   therefore  SP  makes  an  angle  of  45'^  with  CN.
The  following  results  are  required  in  the  theory  of  projec- tion, and  are  illustrated  in  figures  (82)  to  (86).  Two  ellipses are  taken  in  each  case  for  principal  curves,  and  the  supple- mentary hyperbolas  are  shown  by  dotted  lines.  As  the  planes of  the  principal  and  supplementarj^  curves  are  really  at  right angles,  the  intersections  of  the  solid  lines  with  the  dotted  are only  apparent.  The  intersections  of  the  solid  lines  are  real points,  while  the  intersections  of  the  dotted  lines  represent the  imaginary  points.
4919  Two  conies  may  intersect — (i.)   in  four  real  imints  (Fig.  82);
(ii.)   in  ttvo  real  and  two  imaginary  ])oints  (Fig.  83) ; (iii.)  in  four  imaginary  i^oints  (Fig.  84).
[When  the  two  hyperbolas  in  figures  (83)  and  (84)  are  similar  and similarly  situated,  two  of  their  points  of  intersection  recede  to  infinity  (Figs. 85  and  8G).  Hence,  and  by  taking  the  dotted  lines  for  principal,  and  the solid  for  supplementary,  curves,  we  also  have  the  cases]
(iv.)  in  ttvo  real  finite  2^0 ints  and  two  imaginary  points  at infinity  ;
(v.)  in  tivo  imaginary  finite  points  and  two  imaginary points  at  infinity  ;
(vi.)  in  two  imaginary  finite  points  and  two  real  points  at infinity  ;
(vii.)  in  ttvo  real  finite  points  and  two  real  points  at infinity.
4920  Given  two  conies  not  intersecting,  or  intersecting  in but  two  points,  to  draw  the  two  supplementary  curves  which have   a   common    chord    of    intersection    conjugate    to   the
TEE  METHOD  OF  PBOJEGTION.  677
diameters  upon  whicli  tliey  are  described,  or  in  other  words, to  find  tlie  imaginary  common  chord  of  the  conies.
Poncelet  has  shewn  by  geometrical  reasoning  (Proprietes  des  Projectlves, p.  31)  that  such  a  chord  must  exist.  The  following  is  a  method  of  deter- mining its  position —
Let  (abcfgh'^xi/iy  =  0     and     (a'b'c'fg'li''^xyiy  =  0   (i.)
be  the  equations  of  the  conies  G,  C  (Fig.  89),  the  coordinate  axes  being rectangular.  Suppose  PQ  to  be  the  common  chord  sought.  Then  the diameters  AB,  A'B'  conjugate  to  PQ  bisect  it  in  B,  and  the  supplementary curves  on  those  diameters  intersect  in  the  points  P,  Q.  Now,  let  the  coor- dinate axes  be  turned  through  an  angle  B,  so  that  the  y  axis  may  become parallel  to  PQ,  and  therefore  also  to  the  tangents  at  A,B,  A',  B' .  This  is accomplished  by  substituting  for  x  and  y,  in  equations  (i.),  the  values
XG0s9  —  y  &\nd     and     7/ cos  0  + a;  sin 0. Let  the  transformed  equations  be  denoted  by   {ABGFGH'^xyiy  =  0  and {A'B'G'F'G'H''^xyiy  =  0,  in  which  the  coefficients  are  all  functions  of  0, excepting  c,  which  is  unaltered.     Solving  each  of  these  equations  as  a  quad- ratic in  y,  the  solutions  take  the  forms
y  =  a,-(;  +  /3±\//*  {x^  —  2]px  +  q),  y  =  a'x  +  fV  ±  \^fJ.'  (x-  —  2p'x  +  q)  ...(n.), with  the  values  of  a,  13,  /j.,  p,  q  given  in  (4449-53),  if  for  small  letters  we substitute  capitals.  Thus,  a,  /3,  fi,  p,  q  are  obtained  in  terms  of  0  and  the original  coefficients  a,  h,  h,f,  g,  Ji.
Now,  the  coordinates  of  D  being  4  =  ON,   n  =  DN,  we  have   //  =  aE  +  l^
and  jy  =  a'^  +  /3',  therefore       a^  +  ft  =  a^  +  fi'      (iii-)-
The  surd  in  equations  (ii.)  represents  the  ordinate  of  the  conic  conjugate to  the  diameter  AB  or  A'B'.  For  values  of  x  in  the  diagram  >  OM  and <0B,  the  factor  \/—l  appears  in  this  surd,  indicating  an  ordinate  of  the supplementary  curve  on  AB  or  A'B'.  Hence,  equating  the  values  of  the common  ordinate  PD,  we  have
I,  (e-2p-Uq)  =  1^'  (e-2p'Uq)   (iv.).
Eliminating  t,  between  equations  (iii.)  and  (iv.),  we  obtain  an  equation  for determining  0;  which  angle  being  found,  we  can  at  once  draw  the  diameters AB,  A'B'.

Draw UK  the  diameter  of  the  conic  conjugate  to  BB.  Suppose  0  to  be  the required  vertex  of  projection.  Draw  any  plane  EGGD  parallel  to  OBB, intersecting  the  given  conic  in  CB  and  the  line  UK  in  F,  and  draw  the plane  OEK  cutting  the  former  plane  in  E,  F,  G  and  the  line  BB  in  A ;  and let  the  curve  EGGD  be  the  conical  projection  of  HCKD  on  the  plane  parallel to  OBB.

Now,  since  parallel  sections  of  the  cone  are  similar,  if  the  plane  of  ECKD moves  parallel  to  itself,  the  ratio  on  the  right  remains  constant ;  therefore,  by (1193),  the  section  EGGK  is  an  ellipse  in  Fig.  (87)  and  an  hyperbola  in Fig.  (88).  Let  a,  h  be  the  semi-diameters  of  this  ellipse  or  hyperbola parallel  to  EG  and  GD,  that  is,  to  OA  and  BB  ;  then,  by  (2),

a given  conic,  but  in  Fig.  (87)  the  ordinate  of  the  conic  supplementary  to  the given  one  on  the  diameter  conjugate  to  BB.     Therefore
AO'=^AB'     (4).
Hence  AO,  AB  are  parallel  and  propoi'tional  to  a  and  b.  And,  since  AB is  given  in  magnitude  and  direction,  we  have  two  constants  at  our  disposal, namely,  the  ratio  of  the  semi-conjugate  diameters  a  and  b  and  the  angle between  them,  or,  which  is  the  same  thing,  the  eccentricity  and  the  direction of  the  axes  of  the  ellipse  or  hyperbola  on  the  plane  of  projection.
4922     The  construction  will  be  as  follows  : —
Determine  the  point  A  as  the  intersection  of  BB  ivith  the diameter  HK  conjugate  to  it.  Choose  any  j^Iane  of  inojection, and  in  a  plane  through  BB,  parallel  to  it,  measure  AO  of  the length  given  by  equation  (3)  or  (4),  maJiing  the  angle  BAO equal  to  the  required  angle  hetioeen  a  and  b.  0  will  he  the vertex  of  projection^  and  any  plane  IJM.'^  parallel  to  OBB  will serve  for  the  plane  of  pirojection.

Tahe  for  the  line  BB  the  polar  of  the  given  jjoiiit,  and  con- struct as  in  (4922).  For,  ifV  be  the  given  point,  and  BB  its polar  {Fig.  87  or  88),  p  the  projection  ofP  ivill  have  its  polar at  infinity,  and  ivill  therefore  be  the  centre  of  the  projected ellipse  or  hyperbola,  according  as  P  is  within  or  luithout  the original  conic.

Take  the  common  chord  of  the  conies  for  the  line  BB  {Fig. 88),  and  project  each  conic  as  in  (4922),  employing  the  same vertex  and  plane  of  projection.  Then,  since  the  point  A  and the  lines  AB  and  AO  are  the  same  for  each  projection,  corres- ponding conjugate  diameters  of  the  hyperbolas  are  parallel  and proportional  to  AO  and  AB ;  therefore,  Sfc.

Tahe  the  common  chord  for  the  line  BB,  and  construct  as  in (4922).  The  common  pole  of  the  conics  projects  into  a  common centre  and  the  common  tangents  into  common  asymptotes.

*xuOX.  Ex.  1.  — Given  two  conies  having  double  contact  with  each  other, any  chord  of  one  which  touches  the  other  is  cut  harmonically  at  the  point  of contact  and  where  it  meets  the  common  choi'd  of  contact  of  the  conies.
\_Salmons  Conic  Sections,  Art.  354. Let  AB  be  the  common  chord  of  contact,  PQ  the  other  chord  touching the  inner  conic  at  G  and  meeting  AB  produced  in  D.  By  (4929),  project AB,  and  therefore  the  point  D,  to  infinity.  The  conies  become  similar  and similarly  situated  hyperbolas,  and  C  becomes  the  middle  point  of  PQ  (1189). The  theorem  is  therefore  true  in  this  case.  Hence,  by  a  convei'se  projection, the  more  general  theorem  is  inferred.
49oA  Ex.  2. — Given  four  points  on  a  conic,  the  locus  of  the  pole  of  any fixed  line  is  a  conic  passing  tlirough  the  fourth  harmonic  to  the  point  in which  this  line  meets  each  side  of  the  given  quadrilateral.  [Ibid.,  Art.  354. Let  the  fixed  line  meet  a  side  AB  of  the  quadrilateral  in  D,  and  let AGBD  be  in  harmonic  ratio.  Project  the  fixed  line,  and  therefore  the  point D,  to  infinity.  C  becomes  the  middle  point  of  ^ J5  (1055),  and  the  pole  of the  fixed  line  becomes  the  centre  of  the  projected  conic.  Now,  it  is  known that  the  locus  of  the  centre  is  a  conic  passing  through  the  middle  points  of the  sides  of  the  quadrilateral.  Hence,  projecting  back  again,  the  more genei'al  theorem  is  inferred.
4i70o  Ex.  3.  —  If  a  variable  ellipse  be  described  touching  two  given ellipses,  while  the  supplementary  hyperbolas  of  all  three  have  a  common chord  AB  conjugate  to  the  diameters  upon  which  they  are  described ;  the locus  of  the  pole  of  AB  with  respect  to  the  variable  ellipse  is  an  hyperbola whos^e  sup})lementary  ellipse  touches  the  four  lines  CA,  CB,  C'A,  C'B,  where C,  C  are  the  poles  of  AB  with  respect  to  the  fixed  ellipses.
(Salmon,  Art.  355.) Pkoof. — Project  AB  to  infinity  and  the  three  ellipses  into  circles.  The poles  P,  C,  C  become  the  centres  2',  c,  c  of  the  circles.  The  locus  of  p  is  a hyperbola  whose  foci  are  c,  c  .  But  the  lines  Ac,  Be  now  touch  the  supple- mentary ellipse  of  this  hyperbola  (4918).  Therefore,  projecting  back  again, we  get  AC,  BC  touching  the  supplementary  ellipse  of  the  conic  which  is  the locus  of  P.     Similarly,  AC,  BC  touch  the  same  ellipse.
4934  Any  two  lines  at  riglit  angles  project  into  lines  wliicli cut  liannonically  tlie  line  joining  the  two  fixed  points  which are  the  projections  of  the  circnlar  points  at  infinity.
Proof.— This  follows  from  (4723).

4935  The  couverse  of  tlie  above  proposition  (4931),  wbicli  is  the  theorem in  Art.  356  of  Salmon,  is  not  nniversallj  true  in  any  real  sense.  If  the  lines drawn  through  a  given  point  to  the  two  circular  points  at  infinity  form  a harmonic  pencil  with  two  other  lines  through  that  point,  the  latter  two  are not  necessarily  at  right  angles,  as  the  theorem  assumes.
The  following  example  from  the  same  article  is  an  illustration  of  this —
Ex.— Any  chord  BB  (Fig.  88)  of  a  conic  HCKD  is  cut  harmonically  by any  line  PKAH  through  P,  the  pole  of  the  chord,  and  the  tangent  at  K.
The  ellipse  BKB  here  projects  into  a  right  hyperbola  ;  B,  B  project  to infinity.  The  harmonic  pencil  formed  by  PK  and  the  tangent  at  K,  KB  and KB  projects  into  a  harmonic  pencil  formed  by  2^^  fii^d  the  tangent  at  h,  kh and  l-b,  where  6,  h  are  the  circular  points  at  infinity  :  but  j>fc  is  notat  right angles  to  the  tangent  at  J:  of  the  right  hyperbola.  The  harmonic  ratio  of  the latter  pencil  can,  however,  be  independently  demonstrated,  and  that  of  the former  can  then  be  inferred.     (Note  that  h  is  G  in  figure  88.)      _
If  we  may  suppose  the  ellipse  to  project  into  an  imaginary  circle  havmg points  at  infinity,  the  imaginary  radius  of  that  circle  may  be  supposed  to  bo at  right  angles  to  the  imaginary  tangent.  The  right  hyperbola,  however,  is the  real  projection  which  takes  the  place  of  the  circle  in  this  and  all  similar instances  ;  and  it  is  only  in  the  case  of  principal  axes  that  the  radius  is  at I'ight  angles  to  the  tangent.

That  is,  if  the  axes  of  coordinates  be  transformed  in  any manner,  the  ratios  of  the  four  coefficients  in  (4937)  are unaltered.
Proof. — The  transfoi-mation  is  effected  by  a  linear  substitution,  as  in (1704).  Let  «,  «'  thus  become  v,  v'.  Then  hu  +  u'  becomes  Icv  +  v',  and k  is  unaltered.  If  the  equation  ku  +  u'  =  0  represents  two  right  lines,  it  will continue  to  do  so  after  transformation ;  but  the  condition  for  this  is  the vanishing  of  the  cubic  in  h ;  aud  k  being  constant,  the  ratios  of  the  coeffi- cients must  be  unalterable.
4941  The  equation  of  the  six  lines  which  join  the  four points  of  intersection  of  the  conies  u  and  u  is

PuoOF. — Two  of  the  four  points  in  (3941)  must  coincide.  Hence  two  out of  the  three  pairs  of  lines  must  coincide.  The  cubic  (4937)  must  therefore have  two  equal  roots.  Let  a,  a,  ft  be  the  roots ;  then  the  condition  is  the result  of  eliminating  a  and  ft  from  the  equations
A  ('2a  +/-5)  =  -e,      A  (o-  +  2a/3)  =  G',     Aa'/S  =  -A'   (400).
4944  The  expression  (4943)  is  the  last  term  of  the  equation whose  roots  are  the  squares  of  the  differences  of  the  roots  of the  cubic  in  /.-,  and  when  it  is  positive,  the  cubic  in  h  has  two imaginary  roots ;  when  it  is  negative,  three  real  roots ;  aud when  it  vanishes,  two  equal  roots.
Proof.— By  (543)  or  (579).  The  last  term  of /(a;)  in  (543)  is  now =  27F(a)  F(ft),  a,  ft  being  the  roots  of  3Ax'  +  2ex  +  e'  =  0.  When  this term  is  positive,  f(x)  has  a  real  negative  root  (409),  and  therefore  F  (x)  has then  two  imaginary  roots ;  for,  if  (a  — &)'•'  =  —c,  a  — &  =  ic,  and  a  and  b  are both  imaginai'y.  When  the  last  term  of /(;c)  is  negative,  all  the  roots  of /  (x)  are  positive,  aud  therefore  the  roots  of  F  (.^)  are  all  real.

4961  When  u  of  (4936)  represents  two  right  lines.  A' vanishes,  and
4962  0'  =  0  is  the  condition  that  the  two  lines  should intersect  on  u ;
4963  9  =  0  is  the  condition  that  the  two  lines  should  be conjugate  with  regard  to  u.
Proof. — Transform  n'  =  0  into  2xy  =  0,  so  that  the  axes  x,  y  are  the right  lines.  This  will  not  affect  the  invariants  (4940).  We  now  have,  by (4937),  A'  =  0,     e  =  2(/^-c70,     e'  =  -c.
c  =  0  makes  «  pass  through  the  origin  xy  ;  fg  =  ch  makes  x  and  y  conjugate. For  in  (4671),  if  Xx  +  fxy  +  v  becomes  y  =  0,  then  \  =  v  =  0,  and  the  pole is  given  by  H  :  B  :  F.  But  a;  =  a  =  0  at  the  pole,  therefore  II  =. fg-ch  =  0.
4964  The  condition  that  either  of  the  lines  in  u'  should touch  u  is,  by  (4943),
0^  =  4A0'     or     AB  =  0,

4965  The  equation  of  the  two  tangents  to  u,  when  Xa3 +^t^  +  v is  the  chord  of  contact,  is,  with  the  notation  of  (4665),
u^  (X,  fjL,  v)  =  {\a;-{-iii/-{-vzf  A.
Proof. — The  conic  of  double  contact  with  u,  ku  +  (\x  +  fiy  +  i'y-  (4G99), must  now  become  two  right  lines.  In  (4937)  A' =  0  and  Q'  =  0,  therefore A-A  +  6  =  0.     But  0  =  <&  (\,  i-i,  v).     Hence  eliminate  Jc.

4970  If  ?')  u'  be  two  conies,  and  if  6'^  =  4A9',  any  triangle inscribed  in  u'  will  circumscribe  w,  and  conversely.

A=-4,     Q  =  4.(f+g  +  ]i),     Q'^-(f+g  +  hy,     A'=2fg1i', therefore  6^  =  4A6',  a  relation  independent  of  the  axes  of  reference  (4940).

4972  Ex.  (ii.) — The  distance  between  the  centres  of  the  inscribed  and circumscribed  circles  of  a  triangle  is  thus  found,  by  employing  the  values  of e,  e',  and  A  in  (4947),  to  be  D=  ^/(/-±2jt'),  as  in  (936).

f"  =  GH-\-G'H-AF'-A'F,  &c., as  in  (4978-81).
Proof. — This  is  the  reciprocal  of  the  last  theorem.  ZJ+^ZJ' is  a  conic touching  the  four  common  tangents  of  the  conies  U  and  TJ'.  The  trilinear equation  formed  from  this  will,  by  (4007),  be  u^-^-hT  +  k'u'iX' =■  0.  The envelope  of  this  system  of  conies  is  the  equation  above,  which  must  therefore represent  the  four  common  tangents.
The  curve  F  passes  through  the  points  of  contact  of  w  and  lo  with  the locus  represented  by  (4981).
4982  Hence  the  eight  points  of  contact  of  the  two  conies with  their  common  tangents  lie  on  the  curve  F.
4983  The  reciprocal  theorem  from  equation  (4973)  is — The  eight  tangents  at  the  intersections  of  the  conies  envelope the  conic  V.
4984  F  =  0  is  the  locus  of  a  point  from  which  the  tangents to  the  two  given  conies  u,  u'  form  a  harmonic  pencil.
Proof.  —  Putting  7  =  0  in  (4081),  we  get  a  quadratic  of  the  form ad'  +  2]iu^+bl3^'  =■  0,  which  determines  the  two  points  in  which  the  line  y  is cut  by  tangents  from  o',  /3',  y'.  Let  the  similar  quadratic  for  the  second  conic be  a'cr  +  2h'al3  +  h'(3-  =  0.  Then,  by  (1064),  ab'  +  a'b  =  2hh'  is  the  condition that  the  four  points  may  be  in  harmonic  relation.  This  equation  will  be found  to  pi'oduce  F  =  0.

CP'-\-Bf-2Ffiy,      G^y-^Fya-Ca^-Hy\ Af-\-Cd'-2Gya',
and  similarly  for  a,  h',  h',  with  A'  w^ritten  for  A,  &c.
4986  If  the  anJictrmonic  ratio  of  the  pencil  of  four  tangents be  given,  the  locus  of  the  vertex  will  be  F"  =  Jcuu'.  If  the given  ratio  be  infinity  or  zero,  the  locus  becomes  the  four common  tangents  in  (4981).
ANALYTICAL   CONICS.
4987  V  ==  0  is  tlic  envelope  of  a  conic  evciy  tangent  of which  is  cut  harmonically  by  the  two  conies  u,  u' ;  i.e.,  the equation  is  the  condition  that  Xa+^/S  +  vy  should  be  cut  har- monically by  the  two  conies.
Proof. — Eliminate  y  between  the  line  (\,  /u,  v),  and  the  conies  n  and  m' separately,  and  let  AiC  +  2Hal^j  +  Bjy'  =  0  and  A'a'  +  2ircily  +  ]l'ft-  =  0  stand for  the  resulting  equations.  Then,  by  (10G4),  AB' -\-A'1j  =  21111'  produces the  equation  V  =  0,  which,  by  (4GGG),  is  the  envelope  of  a  conic.
4988  The  actual  values  of  A,  H,  B  are  respectively
and  similarly  for  A\  H',  B',  with  a'  for  a,  &c.
4989  F'^  =  4AA'?n/  is  a  covariant  (1629)  of  the  conies  u,  u'.
For  the  four  common  tangents  are  independent  of  the  axes  of  reference.
4990  C7=0  and  V  =  0  (4973)  are  both  contravariants (1814)  of  u  and  n\
Proof. — For  ?7=  0  is  the  condition  that  Xo  +  /j/3  +  ry  =  0  shall  touch  the conic  u ;  and  V  =  0  is  the  condition  that  the  same  lino  shall  be  cut  har- monically by  u  and  u';  and  if  all  the  equations  be  transformed  by  a  recipro- cal substitution  (1813,  '14),  the  right  line  and  the  conditions  I'emain unaltered.
4991  Any  conic  covariant  with  u  and  ii'  can  be  expressed  in terms  of  u,  u,  and  F ;  and  the  tangential  equation  can  be expressed  in  terms  of  U,  U'  and  V.
4992  Ex.  (1). — The  polar  reciprocal  of  u  with  respect  to  u' is  Qn  =  F.
Proof. — Referring  u,  n'  to  their  common  self -conjugate  triangle,
n  =  ax-  +  bij-  +  cz\     It'  =  .c'^  +  y-  +  z-,
F  =  a(h  +  c)  x'  +  h  (c  +  a)  if  +  c  (»  +  h)  z-.
The  polar  of  ^,  r],  ^  with  respect  to  «'  is  ^x  +  riy  +  i^z,  and  the  condition   that
this  may  touch  u  is   hc£i'^  +  caTi^  +  abi,'^  =  0   (4664),  or,  which  is  the  same
thing,  (bc  +  ca  +  ab)(x^  +  y^+z^)  =  P  or  Gw'  =  P  (4945).
4993     Ex.  (2). —The  enveloping  conic  V  in  (4987)  may  also be  written
0//'  +  0'//  =  F.
INVARIANTS  AND  COVAlilANTS.  689
Proof. — With  the  same  assumptions  as  in  Ex.  (1),  V  in  (-i'.To)  becomes (b  +  c)  X'+(c  +  a)  fM-+ (a  +  h)  r- =  0.  The  triliuear  equation  is,  therefore, by  (4667),
(c  +  a) (a  +  b)  X-  +  {a+b){b  +  c)  if  +  (i  +  c) (c  +  a)  £'  =  U, or  (be  +  ca  +  ab) {x-  +  if  +  z')  -\- {a -{- b  +  c)  (ax'  +  bif  +  cz")  =  P.
4994  Ex.  (3). — The  condition  that  F  may  become  two  right
hnes  is  A  A'  (00' -A  A')  =  0.
Proof.— Referring  to  Ex.  (1),  A  =  be,  B  =  ca,  C  =  ab,  F=  G  =  H=0, A'=  B'=  C'=  1 ;  therefore,  in  (4981),  a"  =  B  +  G  =  a(b+c),   &c.     Heuce
the  discriminant  A  of  F  =  ahc  (b  -{- c)(c  +  a)(a-\-h), or  abc  |  (a  +  &  +  c)(&c  +  ca +  a?;)  — ate  |  =  the  above,  by  (4945).
4995  To  reduce  the  two  conies  u,  u  to  the  forms
By  (4945),  o,  /3,  y  will  be  the  roots  of  the  cubic
AF-eF-l-e7.--A'  =  0     (1),
and  cif,  //,  ?:^  will  be  found  in  terms  of  x,  v'  and  F,  by  solving the  three  equations  ,1'-  +  //-  +  ::'^=  n,  a,r-f-/3y^  +  yr  ==  u  and  (by
4994),        a(i3  +  y).r+/3(7  +  a)/  +  y(«+|3)^:-^=:F      (2).
4996  Ex.  (1)  :  Given  ;t;-  +  r  +  -2(/  +  2i^  +  3  =  0;  a;-  +  2^H4;/  +  2a;  +  6  =  0  ; to  be  reduced  as  above.     To  compute  the  invariants,  wef  take

and
Therefore  (4938,  '9)   A  =  1,   6  =  6,  6'=  11,   A'=  6.     The  roots   of  equa- tion  (1)    are  now   1,  2,  3.     Therefore    (2)    becomes    5X-  +  8r^  +  9Z- =  T. Computing  P  also  by  (4981)  with  the  above  values  of  A,  B,  &c.,  we  get  the three  equations  as  under,  introducing  z  for  the  sake  of  symmetry, X-+    Y-+    Z-=    a;-+   7/+   32-+   2//z+    22a;, X-  +  2r-  +  3;;-=    xr  +  ^f+   6.-'-+  4(/2+   2zx, 5X-  +  8YH9i^-  =  5a!2  +  82/-  +  22r  +  16!/2  +  10za;, The  solution  gives   X=x  +  \,    Y  =  \j -\-l,    Z  =  I,   and  the  equations  in  the forms  required  are  (x  +  l)-  +  (y +  iy  +  l  =  0,   (a;  +  l)''  +  2  (^  +  l)-  +  3  =  0.

Let  «  =  X-  +  If  -\-  z'  —  2yz  —  2zx  —  2xy  —  2hkxy,

X  and  y  being  the  sides  touched  by  u.  Then  u  +  hi'  will  be  a  conic  touched by  the  third  side  z.  By  finding  the  invariants,  it  appears  that  9^^  — 4Ae' =  4AA'A;,  whence  k  is  determined,  and  the  envelope  becomes
Compare  (4970).
4998  The  tangential  equation  of  the  two  circular  points  at infinity  (4717)  is
Proof. — This  is  the  condition  that  Xx+fuy  +  v  should  pass  through  either of  those  points,  since  x:^iy  =■  c  is  the  general  form  of  such  a  line.
4999  U  =  0  being  the  tangential  equation  of  a  conic,  the discriminant  of  h  U-{-  TJ'  is
Proof. — The  discriminant  of  hJI-^-  TJ'  is  identical  in  form  with  (4937), but  the  capitals  and  small  letters  must  be  interchanged.  Let  then  the  dis- criminant be  AA;HeA;H©'A;  + A'  =  0.     We  have
A  =  A^  (4G70),  e  =  (BG-F')  A'  +  &c.  =  A'ai\  +  &c.  (4668)  =  A0'. Similarly  6'  =  A'G,  A'  =  A'\
5000  If  ©,  0'  be  the  invariants  of  any  conic  U  and  the  pair of  circular  points  X^  +  ^t'^  (4998) ;  then  G  =  0  makes  the  conic a  parabola,  and  9'  =  0  makes  it  an  equilateral  hyperbola.
Proof.— The  discriminant  of  kU+X^  +  in^  is  k'^A'  +  k  (a  +  h)  A  +  ab-h\ For,  as  above,  A  =  A^ ;  Q  =  A'aA  +  B'bA  =  (a  +  b)  A  since  A' =  B' =  I, C  &c.  =  0  ;  e'  =  {A'B'-m)  G=G  =  ab-Jv';  and  A'  =  0.  The  rest  fol- lows from  the  conditions  (4471)  and  (4474).
5001  The  tangential  equation  of  the  circular  points  is,  in trilinear  notation  (see  the  note  at  5030),
X-+/u,-4-»'"— 2/w,v cos  A—2v\ cosB—2\fjL  cos C.
Proof  :  A.^'  +  yir  =  0,  in  Cartesians,  shows  that  the  perpendicular  lot  fall from  any  point  whatever  upon  any  line  passing  through  one  of  the  points  is infinite.     Therefore,  by  (4624).
5002  The  conditions  in  (4689)  and  (4090),  which  make  the gcmoi-al  conic  a  parabola  or  equilateral  hyperbola,  may  be obtained  by  forming  9  and  9'  for  the  conic  and  equation (5001)  and  applying  (5000).
INVARIANTS  AND  GOVABIANTS.  691
5003  If  0'"'  =  49,  the  conic  passes  througli  one  of  the circular  points.
5004  When  It  in  (4984)  reduces  to  \^-\-ix\  that  is,  to  the circular  points  at  infinity,  F  becomes  the  locus  of  intersec- tion of  tangents  to  n  at  right  angles,  and  produces  the  equa- tions of  the  director-circle  (4693)  and  (4694).
5005  The  tangential  equation  of  a  conic  confocal  with  TJ  is
5006  And  if  the  left  side,  by  varying  k,  be  resolved  into two  factors,  it  becomes  the  equation  of  the  foci  of  the  system.
Proof. — Since  \^  +  /x^  represents  the  two  circular  points  at  infinity  (4998), ;^f/'_^\2-(.^2  _  Q^  jjy  (4914),  is  the  tangential  equation  of  a  conic  touched  by the  four  imaginary  tangents  of  Z7  from  those  points.  But  these  tangents intersect  in  two  pairs  in  the  foci  of  U  (4720)  ;  and,  for  the  same  reason,  in the  foci  of   ]cU+y-+iu-,  which  must  therefore  have  the  same  foci.
If  W  +  X^+fi^  consists  of  two  factors,  it  represents  two  points  which,  by (4913),  are  the  intersections  of  the  pairs  of  tangents  just  named,  and  are therefore  the  foci.
5007  The  general  Cartesian  equation  of  a  conic  confocal with  u  =  0  (4656)  is
k'Au+k  {C{a^'-^y')-2G.v-2Ft/-{-A+B}+l  =  0.
Proof.— (5005)  must  be  transformed.  Written  in  full,  by  (4664),  it becomes  (kA  +  1)  X^  +  (kB  +  l)  fir  +  kCi''.  Hence,  by  (4667),  the  trilinear equation  will  be
{(l-B  +  l)  W-l-F'}  a-  +  &c.  =  F-  (BG-F')  a-  +  kCcr  +  &c.
=  k-a^cr  +  ]cCa'  +  &c.,  (4668)
and  so  on,  finally  writing  x,  y,  1  for  ct,  /3,  y.
TO  FIND   THE  FOCI  OF  THE  GENERAL  CONIC  (4656). (First  Method.)
5008  Substitute  in  kU  +  XHA^'^  eithrr  root  of  its  discriminant k-A'  +  k(a  +  b)  A  +  ab— h^  =  0  (5000),  and  it  becomes  re- solvable into  tioo  factors  (XxiH-/iyi-fv)(Xx.2+/iy2H-v).  _  The foci  are  Xiyi  and  x.^ya,  real  for  one  value  of  k  and  imaginary for  the  other.
Proof.— By  (5006)  the  two  factors  represent  the  two  foci,  consequently the  coordinates  of  the  foci  are  the  coefficients  of  X,  /x,  y  in  those  factors.

Therefore  substitute,  in  the  tangential equation  (4665),  the  coefficients  A  =  1,  /ti  =  i,  v  =  —  (x  +  iy), and  equate  real  and  imaginarij  parts  to  zero.  The  resultirig equations  for  finding  x  and  y  are,  with  the  notation  of  (4665),

{  2\  +  /xy2-3  (2+  v/2)  V  }  {  2A-/iv/2-3  (2-  x/2)  y  } . Therefore  the  coordinates  of  the  foci,  after  I'ationalizing  the  fractions,  are 2- 72            v/2-1           ,           2+72       72  +  1   8      '   8-      '^"'^   3-'      -T-
5014  Otlierwise,  by  the  second  method,  equations  (5010,  '1)  become,  in this  instance,  (3;i;  +  2)^  =  ±  2,  (3/y  — 1)-  =  ±2,  the  sohUion  of  which  pro- duces the  same  values  of  a;  and  y.
5015  When  the  axes  are  oblique,  the  coordinates  x,  y  of  a focus  are  found  from  the  equations

Proof. — Following'  the  method  of  (5009),  the  imaginary  tangent  thi'ough the  focus  is,  by  (4721),  £— .r-f- (»?  — ;(/)(cos  w  +  i  sin  w).  The  two  equations obtained  from  the  tangential  equation  are,  writing  Aa  for  BG  —  F",  &c. (4668),

5019  Otherwise,  let  F  =  u,.,x-{-Uy,y  +  u^,z,  the  polar  of X,  y,  z  (4659),  then  the  condition  that  P'  may  touch  u-\-V"'^ becomes,  in  terms  of  the  coordinates  of  the  poles,

Proof. — The  determinant  is  the  eliminant  of  six  equations  of  the  type (4656)  in  the  one  case  and  (4665)  in  the  otlier.     By  (583).

mVAUIANTS  AND  COVARIANTS.  695
5026  A  system  of  two  conies  has  four  covariant  forms i(,  n,  F,  •/,  conneeted  by  the  equation
-{-Fun  {&&'-3AA')-AA''u'-A'Ahi'' -^A'uhi  {2AQ'-&')-\-Au''h  (2A'0-0'2).
Proof. — Form  the  Jacobian  of  u,  u\  aud  P.  This  will  be  the  equation  of the  sides  of  the  common  self-conjugate  triangle  (4992,  5025).  Compare  the result  with  that  obtained  by  the  method  of  (4995).
5027  By  parity  of  reasoning,  there  are  four  contravariant forms  t/,  U'  V,  r  where  F  is  the  tangential  equivalent  of  */, and  represents  the  vertices  of  the  self-conjugate  triangle.  Its square  is  expressed  in  terms  of  U,  f/',  V  and  the  invariants precisely  as  J^  is  expressed  in  (5026).
5028  The  locus  of  the  centre  of  a  conic  which  always touches  four  given  lines  is  a  right  hue.
Proof. — Let  IT  =  0,  77'  =  0  be  the  tangential  equations  of  two  fixed conies,  each  touching  the  four  lines  ;  then,  by  (4914),  TJ+kTJ'  =  0  is  another conic  also  touching  the  four  lines.     The  coordinates  of  its  centre  will  be
G±kG;_  ^^^  ^1±M^,  by  (4402).  The  point  is  thus  seen,  by  (4032),  to  lie G-{-kG  G-\-kC
on  the  line  joining  the  centres  of  the  two  fixed  conies  and  to  divide  that  line in  the  ratio  hC'  '.  G.
5029  To  find  the  locus  of  the  focus  of  a  conic  touching  four given  lines.
In  the  equations  (5010,  '1)  for  determining  the  coordinates  of  the  focus, write  A-\-kA'  for  A,  &c.,  and  eliminate  k.  The  i-esult  in  general  is  a  cubic curve.  If  2,  2'  be  parabolas,  S  +  /v2'  is  a  parabola  having  three  tangents  in common  with  2  and  2'.  If  (7  =  0'=  0  the  locus  becomes  a  circle.  If  the conies  be  concentric,  they  touch  four  sides  of  a  parallelogram,  and  the  locus is  a  rectangular  hyperbola.
Note  on  Tangential  Coordinates.
5030  It  must  be  borne  in  mind  that  a  tangential  equation  in  trilinear notation  (that  is,  when  the  variables  ai-e  the  coefficients  of  o,  /3,  y  in  the tangent  line  la  +  mlS  +  nY)  will  not  agree  with  the  equation  of  the  same  locus expressed  in  the  tangential  coordinates  \  fj.,  v  of  (4019).  Thus,  to  convert equation  (5001),  which,  for  distinctness,  will  now  be  written
l^-\-m^-Yn'  —  'imn  cos  A—'2nl  cos  B  —  2lm  cos  C*  =  0 into  tangential  coordinates,  we  must  substitute,   by  (4023),   a\,  &/u,  c»'   for I,  m,  n.     The  equation  then  becomes
a-\'"+tV  +  cV-26ccos^/xv-2cacos5^X-2aOcos(7A^  =  0. Put  2tc  COS  J.  =  b^  +  c^  — a^,  &c.,  and  the  result  is  the  equation  as  presented in  (4905).
Corrigenda.— In  (4678)  and  (4692)  erase  the  coefficient  2  ;  and  in  (4680)  and  (4903)  supply the  factor  4  on  the  left  of  the  equation.

For  (5141-3) ;  let  PQ=QE  =  ds  (Fig.  92)  be  equal  consecutive  elements of  the  curve.  Draw  the  normals  at  P,  Q,  E,  and  the  tangents  at  P  and  Q  to meet  the  normals  at  Q  and  E  in  T  and  S.  Then,  if  FN  be  drawn  parallel and  equal  to  QS,  the  point  N  will  ultimately  fall  on  the  normal  QO.  Now the  difference  of  the  projections  of  PT  and  PN  upon  OX  is  equal  to  the  pro- jection of  TN.  Projection  of  PT  =  dsx, ;  that  of  PN  or  QS  =  ds  (x,  +  x.,,ds) (1500);  therefore  the  difference  =  dsx.,,ds  =  TN  cos  a.  But  TN  :  ds  = ds  :  p,  therefore  px.,g  =  cos  a.     Similarly  pi/2s  =  sin  a.

5149  Def.— The  rvolnte  of  a  curve  is  the  locus  of  its  centre of  curvature.  Eegarding  the  evolute  as  the  principal  curve, the  original  curve  is  called  its  involute.
5150  The  normal  of  any  curve  is  a  tangent  to  its  evolute.
Proof.— By  differentiating  equation  (5135)  on  the  hypothesis  that  ^  and V  are  variables  dependent  upon  x,  and  combining  the  result  with  (3),  we obtain  i/^j/j  =  —  1.  ^    ,       l  r>
In  (Fig.  94),  the  normal  at  P  of  the  curve  AP  touches  the  evolute  at  Q. Otherwise  the  evolute  is  the  envelope  of  the  normals  of  the  given  curve.
If  xij  and  ^n  are  the  points  P,  Q,  we  have  the  relations
5151  i=f.f+!^.,=  .p,     jS,  =  ^  =  f-
Proof.— Take  Qn  =  dk  and  ns  =  dr,,  then  Qs  =  dp.  The  projection  of Qn,  ns  gives  dp  in  (5151)  and  proportion  gives  (5152).
5153  The  evolute  and  involute  are  connected  by  the  for- mulae below,  in  which  r\  /,  s  in  the  evolute  correspond  to r,  2^i  s  in  the  involute.

700  THEORY  OF  PLANE  CURVES.
Proof. — From  Fig.  (94),  Jp  =  ±(?s',  &c.,  s  being  tlie  arc  RQ  measured from  a  fixed  point  R.  Hence,  if  a  string  is  wrapped  upon  a  given  curve,  the free  end  describes  an  involute  of  the  curve.     (3155,  'G)  from  Fig.  (93).
5157  To  obtain  tlie  equation  of  the  evolute;  eliminate  x  and ij  from  equations  (5135,  '6)  and  the  equation  of  tlie  curve.
5158  To  obtain  the  polar  equation  of  the  evolute ;  eliminate r  andp  from  (5156)  and  (5157)  and  the  given  equation  of  the curve  r  =  ^(lO-
5159  Ex.— To  find  the  evolute  of  the  catenary  y  =  -^  (e'  +  c' ').     Here
2/^=1  (e^-e''^)  =  ■^^y'-"'') ;  y.,^  =  1  {e^-  +  e"^)  =  ^  ;  so  that  equations

From  these  we  find  y=^,  x  =  ^— j- •/{yf—4c-).  Substituting  in  the equation  of  the  curve,  we  obtain  the  required  equation  in  i,  and  rj.
INVEESE  PROBLEM  AND   INTRINSIC   EQUATION.
An  inverse  question  occurs  when  the  arc  is  a  given  func- tion of  the  abscissa,  say  s  =  (p  (x) ;  the  equation  of  the  curve in  rectangular  coordinates  will  then  be
5160  «/  =  J  v/(4-  1)  d.V.  [From  (5113).
5161  The  intrinsic  equation  of  a  curve  is  an  equation  inde- pendent of  coordinate  axes.  Let  y  =  <l>  {x)  be  the  ordinary equation,  taking  for  origin  a  point  0  on  the  curve  (Fig.  95), and  the  tangent  at  0  for  x  axis.  Let  s  =  arc  OP,  and  xp  the inclination  of  the  tangent  at  P ;  then  the  intrinsic  equation  of the  curve  is
5162  s  =  J  sec  t/».r^  (Ixfj ; where  x^,  is  found  from  tan  x^  =  <l>'{x).

ASYMPTOTES.
5167  Def. — An  asymptote  of  a  curve  is  a  straight  line  or curve  which  the  former  continually  approaches  but  never reaches.     {Vide  1185).
GENERAL  RULES  FOR  RECTILINEAR  ASYMPTOTES.
5168  Rule  I. — Ascertain  if  y^  has  a  limiting  value  when X  =  00  .  If  it  has,  find  the  intercept  on  the  x  or  y  axis,  that is,  X— yxy  or  y— xy^  (5104).
There  toill  be  a.n  asijmptote  parallel  to  the  y  axis  ivhen  y^  is infinite,  and  the  x  intercept  finite,  or  one  parallel  to  the  x  axis ivhen  y^  is  zero  and  the  y  intercept  finite.
5169  Rule  II. —  When  the  equation  of  the  curve  consists  of homogeneous  functions  of  x  and  y,  of  the  m*^,  n^^,  Si'c.  degrees, so  that  it  may  be  written

put  ^ix 4-/3/0?'  y  and  expand  <pUi+  -  ),  &c.,  hij  (1500).    Divide
(1)  hy  X™,  and  make  x  infinite;  then  ({>  (^)  =  0  determines  fi.
Next,  put  this  value  of  /n  in  (1),  divide  hy  x™~\  and  malce  x infinite;  thus  |3f/)' (/i)  + -j^  (^)  =:  0  determines  /3.  Should  the last  equation  he  indeterminate,  then
gives  two  values  for  /3,  and  so  on.
When  n  is  <in  — 1,  /3  =  0,  and  luhen  n  is  >m  — 1,  /3  =  oo  .
5170  Rule  III. — If  </>  (x,  y)  =  0  he  a  rational  integral  equa- tion, to  discover  asymptotes  parallel  to  the  axes,  equate  to  zero the  coefficients  of  the  highest  powers  of  x  and  j,  if  those  co- efficients contain  y  or  x  respectively.
To  find  other  asymptotes — Suhstitute  |itx-|-|3  for  y  in  the original  equation,  and  arrange  according  to  powers  of  :k..  To find  fx,  equate  to  zero  the  coefficient  of  the  highest  power  ofx. To  find  (3,  equate  to  zero  the  coefficient  of  the  next  power  of  x, or,  if  that  equation  be  indeterminate,  take  the  next  coefficient  in order,  and  so  on.
5171  Rule  IV. — If  the  polar  equation  of  the  curve  he  v  =  i{0) and  if  r^  CO  makes  the  polar  suhtangent  v^Q^^q,  a  finite  quan- tity, there  is  an  asymptote  whose  equation  is  r  cos  {0  —  a)  =  c  ; where  a  +  ^tt  =  f~^  (00  )  =  the  value  of  B  of  the  curve  when  r  is infinite.
5172  Asymptotic  curves. — In  these  tlie  difference  of  corres- ponding ordinates  continually  diminishes  as  x  increases.
As  an  example,  the  curves  y  =  (^  {'•i')  and  y  =  <}>  (^')  H —  are  asymptotic.
5173  Ex.  1. — To  find  the  asymptotes  of  the  curve
(a  +  S.c)(x^  +  f)  =  4.c'^       (1).
The  coefficient  of  7/^,  a  +  Sx  =  0,  gives  an  asymptote  parallel  to  the  1/  axis. Putting  y  =  fix  +  ft,   (1)  becomes
(a  +  3x)(x-  +  i.'x-  +  2fiilt  +  rr)-4x'  =  0    (2).
The  coefficient  of  x\  3  (1  +a^-)-4  =  0  gives  /i  =  ±  -^.     Substituting  this
V  "J
value  of /J  in  (2),  the  coefficient  of  »'  becomes  -  -  ±  — ~  ;  and  this,  equated to  zero,   gives  ft  =  ^  .     Hence  the  equations  of  two  more  asymptotes
are  a^z/S  =  ±  (3.c-2a).
SINGVLAUITIES  OF  CURVES.  703
Ex.  2. — To  find  an  asymptote  of  the  curve  r  cos  6  =:  a  cos  2d.     Here ^.2  de  _  a^  cos  2d
dr       a  cos  20  sin  0  — 2a  sin  20  cos  0 When  ?•  =  CO  ,   d  =  lir,   and  rfl,.  =  —a.     Hence  the  equation  of  the  asymp- tote is   r  cos  0  =  —a.
SINGULARITIES   OF   CURVES.
5174  Concavity  and  Convexity. — A  curve  is  reckoned  convex or  concave  towards  the  axis  of  x  according  as  yv/gx  is  positive or  negative.
POINTS  OF  INFLEXION.
5175  ^4,  2)oint  of  Injiexion  (Fig.  96)  exists  where  the  tangent has  a  Umiting  position,  and  therefore  where  v/.^.  takes  a  maxi- mum or  minimum  vahie.
5176  Hence  7/2,,  must  vanish  and  change  sign,  as  in  (1832).
5177  Or,  more  generally,  an  even  number  of  consecutive derivatives  of  7/  =  ^  (,t)  must  vanish,  and  the  curve  will  pass from  positive  to  negative,  or  from  negative  to  positive,  with respect  to  the  axis  of  re,  according  as  the  next  derivative  is negative  or  positive.

5178  ^  multiple  jpoint,  known  also  as  a  node  or  crunode, exists  when  y^.  has  more  than  one  value,  as  at  B  (Fig.  98),  If (}>  {x,  y)  =  0  be  the  curve,  f ,.  and  (j>y  must  both  vanish,  by (1713).  Then,  by  (1704),  two  values  of  v/,.  determining  a double  point  J  will  be  given  by  the  quadratic
<^2.^!.  +  2(^..^/..  +  <^2,.   =   0         (1).
5179  If  i>ij;,  ^2</3  'Pxy  also  vanish;  then,  by  (1705),  three values  of  y,.,  determining  a  triple  jw I nt,  will  be  obtained  from the  cubic

CUSPS.
5181  When  two  branches  of  a  curve  have  a  common  tan- gent at  a  point,  but  do  not  pass  through  the  point,  they  form a  cusj)i  termed  also  a  spinode  or  stationary  jJoint.
5182  In  the  first  sjiecies,  or  ceratoid  cusp  (Fig.  100),  the two  values  of  ^j.^x  have  opposite  signs.
5183  In  the  second  species,  or  raniphoid  cusp  (Fig.  101), they  have  the  same  sign.
CONJUGATE  POINTS.
5184  A  conjugate  point,  or  acnode,  is  an  isolated  point  whose coordinates  satisfy  the  equation  of  the  curve.  A  necessary condition  for  the  existence  of  a  conjugate  point  is  that  ^^.  and (j)y  must  both  vanish.
Pkoof. — For  the  tangent  at  such  a  point  may  have  any  direction,  there- fore —    is  indeterminate  (1713).
5185  There  are  four  species  of  the  trij^le  point  according  as it  is  formed  by  the  union  of
(i.)  three  crunodes,  as  in  (Fig.  102) ;
(ii.)  two  crunodes  and  a  cusp,  as  in  (Fig.  103) ;
(iii.)  a  crunode  and  two  cusps,  as  in  (Fig.  104) ;
(iv.)  when  only  one  real  tangent  exists  at  the  point.
5186  Ex.  — The  equation  if  =  {x-a){,v-h){x-c)^  when a  -Ch  <ic  represents  a  curve,  such  as  that  drawn  in  (Fig.  07).

SINGULARITIES  OF  GURV^S.  705
When  b  =  c  the  curve  takes  the  form  in  (Fig.  98).     But if,  instead,  h  =  a,  the  oval  shrinks  into  a  point  A  (Fig.  99). li  a  =  b  =  c  the  point  A  becomes  a  cusp,  as  in  (Fig.  100).
A  geometrical  method  of  investigating;  singular  points.
5187  Describe  an  elementary  circle  of  radius  r  round  the point  X,  y  on  the  curve  (p  {x,  y)  =  0,  intersecting  the  curve  in the  point  x-\-h,  y-\-h.  Let  h  =  r  cos  B,  k  =  r  sin  0.  Expand ^  {x-\-h,  y-\-h)  =  0  by  (1512),  and  put  «/>,,  =  ii  siny,  ^y  = K  cos  y.     We  thus  obtain
K  sin  (y  +  0)-\-^  (<^2,,  cos^  d  +  2./,.,^  sin  0  cos  0  +  (p,^  sin-  e)-\-—  =0
Bj  being  put  for  the  rest  of  the  expansion    (.'■)'
According  as  the  quadratic  in  tan  0,
(^,.r  +  2(/),^^  tan  0  +  (^2i/  tan-  0  =  0, has  real,  equal,  or  imaginary  roots ;  i.e.,  according  as i>ly  —  hxi^iy  is  positive,  zero,  or  negative,  xy  will  be  a  crunode, a  cusp,  or  an  acnode.  By  examining  the  sign  of  B,  the species  of  cusp  and  character  of  the  curvature  may  be  deter- mined.
Figures  (105)  and  (106),  according  as  B  and  ^2^  liave opposite  or  like  signs,  show  the  nature  of  a  crunode ;  and figures  (107)  and  (108)  show  a  cusp.
Proof. — At  an  ordinary  point  the  circle  cuts  the  curve  at  the  two  points given  by  6  = —y,  9  =  7r  — y.  But,  if  f^^  and  ^^  both  vanish,  there  is  a singular  point.     Writing  A,  B,  G  for  <po^,  f-,^,  (poy,  equation  (1)  now  becomes
C'cos^^[tan-^0+^tane+||+^  =  O   (2).
(i.)   If  B^>AGy,  this  may  be  put  in  the  form
G  cos^  d  (tan  d  -  tan  a)  (tan  6  -  tan  /3)  +  ^  =  0,
and  the  points  of  intersection  with  the  circle  are  given  by  6  =  a,  ft,  tt  +  o, and7r  +  /3.     (Figs.  105  and  106.)
(ii.)  When  B^  =  AG,  we  may  write  equation  (1)
27? (7cos'0(tan0-tana)-+^  =  0.
If  B  and  G  have  opposite  signs,  there  is  a  cusp  with  a  for  the  inclination  of the  tangent  (Fig.  107).  So  also,  if  B  and  G  have  the  .same  sign,  the  inclina- tion and  direction  being  v  +  a  (Fig.  108).  The  cusps  exist  in  this  ca.se because  B  changes  its  sign  when  tt  is  added  to  6,  B  being  a  homogeneous function  of  the  third  degree  in  sin  6  and  cos  0.
(iii.)  If  B^<  AG,  there  are  no  real  points  of  intersection,  and  therefore  xij is  an  acnode.

CONTACT   OF    CURVES.
5188  A  contact  of  the  n^^^  order  exists  between  two  curves when  n  successive  derivatives,  y^.,  ...  y^^  or  Tg,  ...  r^g,  corres- pond. The  curves  cross  at  the  point  if  n  be  even.  No  curve can  pass  between  them  which  has  a  contact  of  a  lower  order with  either.
Ex. — The  curve  y  =■  <p  («)  has  a  contact  of  the  n^^  order,  at  the  point where  x  =  a,   with  the  curve   y  =  (f>  (a)  +  (x  —  a)  ^'(a)  -f  ...  +  ^ — ~-  ch"  (a).
5189  Cor. — If  the  curve  y  =f(x)  has  n  parameters,  they may  be  determined  so  that  the  curve  shall  have  a  contact  of the  {n  —  iy^'  order  with  y  =  (j>  (x).
A  contact  of  the  first  order  between  two  curves  implies  a common  tangent,  and  a  contact  of  the  second  order  a  common radius  of  curvature.

and  these  determine  the  conic.

Proof. — In  Fig.  93,  let  0  be  the  centre  of  the  conic  and  P  the  point  of contact.  The  five  disposable  constants  of  the  general  equation  of  a  conic will  be  determined  by  the  following  five  data :  two  coordinates  of  0,  a  com- mon point  P,  a  common  tangent  at  P,  and  the  same  radius  of  curvature  PQ.
Since  V  =  POT,  cW  =  POP',  dx^  =  TOT',  and  ds  =  PP',  we  have,  in passing  from  P  to  P',   di'  =  P'OT—POT  =  d^P-dO.     Now  rdd  =  ds  cos  v,
therefore     =  -~-   =  —   — ;    and  tan  v    has   been   found    in    the

5192  An  envelope  of  a  curve  is  the  locus  of  the  ultimate intersections  of  the  different  curves  of  the  same  species,  got by  varying  continuously  a  parameter  of  the  curve ;  and  the envelope  touches  all  the  intersecting  curves  so  obtained.
5193  Rule. — If  F  (x,  y,  a)  =  0  be  a  curve  having  the  para- meter a,  the  envelope  is  the  curve  obtained  by  eliminating  a betiveen  the  equations
F  (a?,  ?/,  a)  =  0     and     d^F  (.i',  y,  a)  =  0.
708  THEORY  OF  PLANE  CURVES.
Proof. — Let  a  change  to  a  +  h.     The  coordinates  of  the  point  of  intersec- tion of   F  (x,  y,  a)  =  0  and  F  (:c,  y,  a  +  h)  =0  satisfy  the  equation

The  envelope  of  these  curves  will be  found  by  differentiating  all  the  equations  with  respect  to a,  h,  c,  &c.,  and  eliminating  da,  dh,  ...  and  a^b,  ...

By  differ- entiating for  X  and  y,  (5136)  is  found,  and  the  elimination  as  directed  in (5157)  produces  the  equation  of  the  evolute  which,  by  (5194),  is  the  envelope of  the  curve.

PEDAL   CURVES.
5220  The  locus  of  tlie  foot  of  the  perpendicular  from  the origin  upon  the  tangent  is  called  ^  jpeclal  curve.  The  pedal  of the  pedal  curve  is  called  the  second  pedal,  and  so  on.  Re- versing the  order,  the  envelope  of  the  right  lines  drawn  from each  point  of  a  curve  at  right  angles  to  the  radius  vector  is called  t\ie  first  negative  jpedal,  and  so  on.

P-Q=C,     P+Q  =  i  jVv/t/f,     2P  =  C+iJ r'dxff.

AREA  OF  A  ROULETTE.
5230  When  a  closed  curve  rolls  upon  a  right  line,  the  area generated  in  one  revolution  by  the  normal  to  the  roulette  at the  generating  point  is  twice  the  area  of  the  pedal  of  the rolling  curve  with  respect  to  the  generating  point.
Proof. — (Fig-  112.)  Let  P  be  the  point  of  contact  of  the  rolling  curve and  fixed  straight  line,  Q  the  point  which  generates  the  roulette.  Let  B  bo a  consecutive  point,  and  when  B  comes  into  contact  with  the  straight  line, let  P'Q'  be  the  position  of  itQ.  Then  PQ  is  a  normal  to  the  roulette  at  Q, and  P  is  the  instantaneous  centre  of  rotation.  Draw  (^N,  QS  perpendiculars on  the  tangents  at  P  and  R.  The  elemental  area  PQQ'P',  included  between the  two  normals  QP,  Q'P',  is  ultimately  equal  to  PQB+QRQ'.  But  PQB =  dC,  an  element  of  the  area  of  the  curve  swept  over  by  the  radius  vector QP  or  r  round  the  pole  Q  ;   and    Q22Q'  =  ^r^d^^ ;   therefore,   whole  area   of
roulette  =  C+\  \''r'd^  =  2P,  by  (5224).
5231  Hence,  by  (5228),  tliere  is  one  point  in  any  closed curve  for  which  the  area  of  the  corresponding  roulette  is  a

minimum.  Also  the  area  of  the  roulette  described  by  any other  point,  distant  c  from  the  origin  of  the  minimum  roulette, exceeds  the  area  of  the  latter  by  wc^.
5232  When  the  line  rolled  upon  is  a  curve,  the  whole  area generated  in  one  revolution  of  the  rolling  curve  becomes
Jo         \  p   '
where  p,  p  are  the  radii  of  curvature  of  the  rolling  and  fixed curves,  and  G  is  the  area  of  the  former.
Proof. — (Fig.  113.)  Instead  of  the  angle  d\j/,  we  now  have^ie  sum  of the  angles  of  contingence  at  P  of  the  rolling  curve  and  fixed  curve,  viz.,
since  pdvj/  =:  ds  =  p'dijj',  by  (5146),
LENGTH  OF  THE  ARC  OF  A  ROULETTE.
5233  If  (^  and  I  be  corresponding  arcs  of  the  roulette  and the  pedal  whose  origin  is  the  generating  point ;  then,  when the  fixed  line  is  straight,  a  =  I;  and  when  it  is  a  curve,
5234  ^da  =  ^{l+Pr)dC
Proof. — (Fig.  112.)  Let  B  be  the  point  which  has  just  left  the  straight line,  Q  the  generating  point,  N,  8  consecutive  points  on  the  pedal  curve. Draw  the  circle  circumscribing  BQN8,  of  which  BQ  -—  r  is  a  diameter,  and let  the  diameter  which  bisects  NS  meet  the  circle  in  K.  Then,  when  the points  P,  B,,  P'  coincide,  KN  and  BQ  are  diameters,  and  SKN  =  SPN  =  f/i/' =  QBQ' ;  tlierefore  SN  or  d^  =  rdij/  =  QQ'  or  da.

RADIUS  OF  CURVATURE  OF  A  ROULETTE.

from  which  B  is  obtained.  If  the  curvature  of  the  roulette  is  convex  to- wards P  (Fig.  114),  we  must  write  B  +  r  instead  of  B  —  r  above.
5236  The  curvature  is  convex  towards  P  when  B  is  posi- tive, that  isj  wlien  the  carried  point  Q  falls  within  the  circle whose  diameter  measured  on  the  normal  of  the  rolling  curve
=    ^^  ,.     When  Q  falls  without  this  circle,  the  curvature  is
concave ;  and  when  Q  falls  upon  the  circumference,  the  point is  one  of  inflexion.  The  circle  has  for  this  reason  been  called the  circle  of  inflexions.
5237  In  figure  (163)  let  PA  =  p,  PB  =  p,  PQ  =  r,  OQ  =  R, as  in  (5235).     Draw  PGD,  the  circle  of  inflexions,  with  its
diameter  PG  =  -^^—„  and  therefore  PD  =    ^^  ,cos  a.     From

these  values  and  proportion  it  follows  that  BG  :  BP  :  BA  and QD  :  QP  :  QO.  Also,  if  the  circle  on  diameter  PE  =  PG  be drawn,  AE  :  AP  :  AB  and  OF  :  OP  :  OQ.
5238  A  simple  construction  for  the  centre  of  curvature  of the  roulette  is  the  following.  (Fig.  164,  with  letters  as  in 5237.)  At  P  draw  a  perpendicular  to  PQ  to  meet  QB  in  N. Join  NA,  which  will  meet  Q,P  produced  in  0,  the  required point.
Pkoof. — From  equation  (5235),  assuming  0  to  be  the  centre  of  curvature, we  can  deduce  the  relation  {BA  :  AP){PO  :  OQ)(QN  :  NB)  =  1,  therefore, by  (9G8),  A,  0,  N  are  collinear  points.
THE  ENVELOPE  OF  A  CARRIED  CURVE.
5239  When  a  curve  is  rigidly  connected  with  a  rolling curve,  it  will  have  an  envelope.  The  path  of  its  point  of contact  with  the  envelope  is  a  tangent  to  both  curves,  and therefore  the  normal,  common  to  the  carried  curve  and  its envelope,  passes  through  the  point  of  contact  P  of  the  rolling and  fixed  curve.
5240  The  centre  of  curvature  of  the  envelope  is  obtained  as follows.
TBAJECT0BIE8,  ^c.  715
In  Fig.  (163),  from  P  draw  a  normal  to  the  carried  curve  meeting  it  in Q,  and  let  8  on  PQ  he  the  centre  of  curvature  of  the  envelope  for  the  point Q  ;  and  0  that  of  the  cai'ried  curve.     Then  PS  is  found  from

5241  When  the  envelope  is  a  right  hne,  the  centre  of  curva- ture lies  on  the  circle  of  inflexions  (5236).  When  the  carried curve  is  a  right  line,  the  same  point  lies  on  the  circle  PEF (Fig.  163),  and  if  the  right  line  always  passes  through  a  fixed point,  that  point  lies  on  the  circle  PEF.

INSTANTANEOUS  CENTRE.
5243     When  a  plane  figure  moves  in  any  manner  in  its  own
plane,  the  instantaneous  centre  of  rotation  is  the  intersection of  the  perpendiculars  at  two  points  to  the  directions  in  which the  points  are  moving;  and  a  line  from  the  instantaneous centre  to  any  point  of  the  figure  is  the  normal  to  the  path  of that  point.
Ex. — Let  a  triangle  ABG  slide  with  its  vertices  A,  B  always  upon the  right  lines  OA,  OB.  The  perpendiculars  at  J.,  B  to  OJ.,  OB  meet  in  Q, the  instantaneous  centre,  and  QC  is  the  normal  at  G  to  the  locus  of  G.
Since  AB  and  the  angle  AOB  are  of  constant  magnitude,  OQ,  the diameter  of  the  circle  circumscribing  OAQB,  is  of  constant  magnitude. Hence  the  locus  of  the  instantaneous  centre  (^  is  a  circle  of  centre  0  and radius  OQ.
5244  Holditch's  Theorem. — If  a  chord  of  a  given  length  LM moves  completely  round  a  closed  curve,  the  area  enclosed between  the  curve  and  the  locus  of  a  point  P  on  the  chord  is equal  to  ircc  where  c  =  LK,  d  =  MK.
5245  If  the  ends  of  LM  move  on  different  closed  curves whose  areas  are  X,  /u,  while  the  area  described  by  K  is  /c,  then
K  =    '-^T   TTCC  .

TRAJECTORIES.
5246  Def. — A  trajectory  is  a  curve  which  cuts  according  to a  given  law  a  system  of  curves  obtained  by  varying  a  single parameter.
The  differential  equation  of  the  trajectory  which  cuts  at  a constant  angle  |3  the  system  of  curves  represented  by ^  {x,  y,  c)  =  0  is  obtained  by  ehminating  c  between  the equations
c/,  Cv,  y,  c)  =  0     and     tau  jB  =  ^f^^\
the  derivatives  of  <^  being  partial,  and  y^  referring  to  the trajectory.*
Proof.  —  At  a  point  of  intersection  we  have  for  the  given  curve m  =  —0^-1-^^^,  and  for  the  trajectory  m'  =  yx-     Employ  (4070).
If  the  trajectory  is  to  be  orthogonal,  tan  /3  =  oo  ,  and  the second  equation  becomes
Ex. — To  find  the  curve  which  cuts  at  a  constant  angle  all  right  linos passing  through  the  origin.
Let  y  =  ex  represent  these  lines  by  varying  c ;  then,  writing  n  for  tan  ft, the  two  equations  become  y  —  cx  =  0  and  n  (1+cy:,)  =  y^  —  c.  Eliminating c,  ^Vx—y  =  '>i(yyx  +  x)-     Divide  by  x'  +  y^'  and  integrate;  thus

CURVES   OP   PURSUIT.
5247  Def. — A  curve  of  pursuit  is  the  locus  of  a  point  wliich moves  with  uniform  velocity  towards  another  point  while  the latter  describes  a  known  curve  also  with  uniform  velocity.
Let  f(x,  7/)  =  0  be  the  known  curve,  xy  the  moving  point upon  it,  ^rf  the  pursuing  point,  and  n  :  1  the  ratio  of  their velocities.  The  differential  equation  of  the  path  of  ^rj  is obtained  by  eHminating  x  and  y  between  the  equations

(iii.)  follows  from  1  :  ?i  =  •/(d^'^  +  cW)  :  ^/{iW-\-cly')  ;  the  elements  of arc  described  being  proportional  to  the  velocities.
Ex. — The  simplest  case,  being  the  problem  usually  presented,  is  that  in which  the  point  xy  moves  in  a  right  line.  Let  x  =■  a  be  this  line,  and  let the  point  ^i/  start  from  the  origin  when  the  point  xy  is  on  the  x  axis.  The equations  (i.),  (ii.),  (iii.)  now  become,  since  x^  =  0,
x  =  a,     y  =  rj  +  r}^(a—^),     ?/,  =«y(l  +  ?jp.

CAUSTICS.
5248  Dep- — If  right  lines  radiating  from  a  point  be  reflected from  a  given  plane  curve,  the  envelope  of  the  reflected  rays  is called  the  caustic  by  reflexion  of  the  curve.
Let  (p  {x,  y)  =  0,  xp(x,  y)  =  0  be  the  equations  of  the tangent  and  normal  of  the  curve,  and  let  1th  be  the  radiant point;  then  the  equation  of  the  reflected  ray  will  be
(^(/^,A•)VG^^;/)4-V'(/^,A:)(^G^^^/)  =  0,
and  the  envelope  obtained  by  varying  the  coordinates  of  the point  of  incidence,  as  explained  in  (5194),  will  be  the  caustic of  the  curve.
Ex.— To  find  the  caustic  by  reflexion  of  the  circle  x"  +  i/  =  r,  the  radiant l^oint  being  hJc.
Taking  for  the  tangent  and  normal,  as  in  (4140),  a;  cos  a +  ?/ sin  a  =  r, and  X  sill  a  — y  cos  a  =  0,   the  reflected  ray  is
(h  cos  a  +  Jc  sin  a — r)(:e  sin  a  —  y  cos  a) +  (h  sin  a  — A:  cosa)(.i;  cos  a  +  y  sin  a  — r)  =  0. Reducing  this  to  the  form
A  cos2a  +  I>  sin  2a  +  (7  sin  a  — D  cos  a  =  0, and  differentiating  for  a,
-2^  sin  2a  +  25  cos  2a+ 6' cos  ct  +  D  sin  a  =  0. The  result  of  eliminating  a  is
{4^(h'  +  k'){x'  +  y')-r\x  +  hy-r\y  +  hyy  =  27  0cx-hi/y(x'  +  y'-h'-k'y, the  envelope  and  caustic  required.
5249  QuetelcVs  Theorem. — The  caustic  of  a  curve  is  the evolute  of  the  locus  of  the  image  of  the  radiant  point  with respect  to  the  tangent  of  the  curve.
Thus,  in  the  Fig.  of  (1178),  if  S  bn  the  radiant  point,  W  is  the  image  in the  tangent  at  P.  The  locus  of  W  is,  hi  this  case,  a  circle,  and  the  evolute and  caustic  reduce  to  the  single  point  S'.
Since  the  distance  of  the  image  from  the  radiant  point  is twice  the  perpendicular  on  the  tangent,  it  follows  that  the locus  of  the  image  will  always  be  got  by  substituting  2r  for  r
in  the  polar  equation  of  the  pedal,  or   ^   for   r  in  the  polar
equation  of  the  reciprocal  of  the  given  curve  with  respect  to the  radiant  point  and  a  circle  of  radius  k.

THE  CYCLOID.*  (Fig.  115)
5250  Def. — A  cycloid  is  the  roulette  generated  by  a  circle rolling  upon  a  right  line,  the  carried  point  being  on  the  cir- cumference. When  the  carried  point  is  without  the  circum- ference, the  roulette  is  called  ^ iwolate  cycloid;  and,  when  it  is within,  a  curtate  cycloid.
5251  The  equations  of  the  cycloid  are
,1-=  a  (^-f-sin  ^),         ?/ =  a  (1  — cos  ^),
where  B  is  the  angle  rolled  through,  and  a  the  radius  of  the generating  circle.
Proof. — (Fig.  115.)  Let  the  circle  KPT  roll  upon  the  line  BE,  the point  P  meeting  the  line  at  D  and  again  at  E.  Arc  KP  =  KB  ;  therefore arc  FT  =  AK  =  OT.  Also  6  =  PGT,  the  angle  rolled  through  from  A,  the centre  of  the  base  EB.     Then
x=  OT+TN=  ad  +  a  sin  d;      y  =  FN  =  a-a  cosd.
5253     If  s  be  the  arc  OP  and  p  the  radius  of  curvature  at  P, s  =  IPT  =  v/(8«//),         p  =  2PK.
Proof.— (i.)  The  element  Pp  =  Bh  =  2  (OB- Oh)  ultimately;  therefore, by  summation,  s  =  20B.     Also  OB  =  FT  =  ^{TK. TR)  =  ^/{2ay).
(ii.)  Let  two  consecutive  normals  at  P  and  p  intersect  in  L.  Then  FL, pi  are  parallel  to  BA,  bA  ;  therefore  PLp  is  similar  to  BAi.  But  Pp  =  2Bi  ; therefore  p  or  FL  =  2BA  =  2PK.
5255  CoE. — The  locus  of  L,  that  is  the  evolute  of  the cycloid,  consists  of  two  half-cycloids  as  shown  in  the  diagram.
5256  The  area  of  a  cycloid  is  equal  to  three  times  the  area of  the  generating  circle,  and  the  curve  length  is  four  times the  diameter  of  the  same  circle.
Proof.  —  (i.)  Area  FpvN  =  FprR  =  BhqQ  ultimately.  Therefore,  by summation,  DiJ.^0  — cycloid  =  Tral  But  BE .AO  =  2wa.2a  =  47ra^;  there- fore cycloid  =  Stto,^.

The  cycloid  is  prolate  when  m  is  >  1  (Fig.  116),  and  curtate when  m  is  <  1  (Fig.  117),  m  being  the  ratio  of  GP  to  the radius  a.

722  THEOIiY  OF  PLANE  CURVES.
5270  The  length  of  the  arc  of  an  epicycloid  or  hypocycloid included  between  two  successive  cusps  is
—  (u  ih  f>),  ^nd  the  included  area  is  —  (3a  ±  26) . a  ^  a    ^
Proof. — Putting  m  =  1  into  (5265)  and  aO  =■  h(p,  the  length  becomes

5271  The  evolute  of  an  epicycloid  is  a  similar  epicycloid.
Proof. — The  equation  of  the  tangent  referred  to  an  x  axis  drawn  through the  summit  of  the  curve  will  be  (by  turning  axes  through  an  angle  hir  —  a),
X  cos      '        d-\-y  sin     ^       0=  (a  +  2&)  cos  —0.
Comparing  this  with  (5270),  which  is  the  equation  of  the  tangent  of  the evolute,  we  see  that  the  epicycloid  and  its  evolute  are  similar  curves  having their  parameters  in  the  ratio  a  +  'lh  :  a;  and  that  the  radius  drawn  through a  cusp  of  either  of  the  curves  passes  through  a  summit  of  the  other.
5272  When  h  =  —\a,  the  hypocycloid  becomes  a  straight line,  namely,  a  diameter  of  the  fixed  circle.
THE  CATENARY.  (Fig.  119)
5273  Gharacteristic. — The  perpendicular  TP  from  the  foot of  the  ordinate  upon  the  tangent  is  of  a  constant  length  c,  and therefore  equal  to  OA,  the  perpendicular  from  the  origin  on the  tangent  at  the  vertex,  r  is  the  parameter  of  the  curve. The  equation  is

5278  The  catenary  derives  its  name  from  a  chain,  which, when  suspended  from  its  extremities,  takes  the  form  of  this curve.
For  the  equation  of  the  evolute  of  the  catenary,  see  (5159).
THB   TRACTRIX.  (Fig.  119)
5279  Gharacteristlc. — The  length  of  the  tangent  intercepted by  the  x  axis  is  constant.  This  curve  is  the  involute  of  the catenary,  being  the  locus  of  P  in  Figure  (119).
The  equation  of  the  tractrix  is
5280  .r  =  c  log  {c-\-s/{c'-u')}  -c  \ogi/-^{c'-i/).
Proof. — Let  the  tangent  FT  =  c,  then  the  differential  equation  of  the curve  is  therefore  yx^  =  —\/G-  —  'if.  Substitute  z  —  s/c'  —  y\  and  integrate by  (1937).
5281  The  area  included  by  the  four  branches  =  7^c^
Proof. — Area  =  4    ?/(Z.c  =  —  4     ■/c-—y"-dy  =  7^c^  by  (1933).
THE  SYNTRACTRIX.
5282  This  curve  is  the  locus  of  a  point  Q  on  the  tangent  of the  tractrix  in  Fig.  (119).  Let  Q^  be  equal  to  a  given  con- stant length  d ;  then  the  equation  of  the  syntractrix  will  be

724  THEORY  OF  PLANE  CURVES.
THE  LOGARITHMIC   CURVE.*  (Fig.  120)
5284  Gharacteristic. — The  subtangenfc  is  constant. The  equation  of  the  curve  is  either
5285  y  =  aen,     or     x  =  n\og^,
where  n  =  NT^  the  constant  subtangent,  and  a  is  the  intercept on  the  y  axis.
5287  If  ^i  ^6  an  even  integer,  y  may  take  negative  values. The  most  general  form  of  the  equation  may  perhaps  be assumed  to  be

THE  EQUIANGULAR  SPIRAL.  (Fig.  121)

measuring  s  from  the  pole. Proof.— By  (5112)  and  (5200).
5293  Hence  the  length  of  the  spiral  measured  from  the  pole 0  to  a  point  P  (Fig.  121)  is  equal  to  PS,  the  intercept  on  the tangent  made  by  the  polar  subtangent  OS.
5294  The  locus  of  S  is  a  similar  spiral,  and  is  also  an  invo- lute of  the  original  curve.
5295  The  pedal  curve,  which  is  the  locus  of  Y,  is  also  a similar  equiangular  spiral.
Proof. — The  constancy  of  the  angle  ^  makes  the  figure  OPTS  always similar  to  itself.  Therefore  P,  Y,  and  S  describe  similar  curves.  Hence,  if ST  is  the  tangent  to  the  locus  of  >S,  OST  =  <p  =  OPS ;  therefore  PST  is  a right  angle ;  therefore  the  locus  of  *S'  is  an  involute  of  the  original  spiral.  J

THE  SPIRAL  OF  ARCHIMEDES.*  (Pig.  122)
5296  Gharacteristic. — The  distance  from  the  pole  is  propor- tional to  the  angle  described.     Hence  the  equation  is
5297  r  =  aO.      Also  tan  (^  =  ^.  By  (5112).
5299  The  intercept,  FQ,  on  any  radius  between  two  succes- sive convolutions  of  the  spiral,  is  constant  and  =  2<X7r.
5300  The  area  swept  over  by  any  radius  is  one  third  of  the corresponding  circular  sector  of  that  radius.
5301  This  curve  is  one  of  the  class  the  general  equation  of which  is

5303  An  asymptote  is  the  line  ?/  =  «.  (51^1)
5304  The  spiral  is  also  an  asymptote  to  itself.
For  when  the  radius  is  of  the  first  order  of  smallness,  the  distance between  two  successive  convolutions  is  of  the  second  order.  Hence  the distance  to  the  pole  measu.red  along  the  curve  is  infinite.

726  THEORY  OF  PLANE  CURVES.
Proof. — Let  ?•',  0'  be  the  coordinates  of  Y  on  the  pedal  curve.     Then r'=J]P  =  arc .42?=  a(d'+U).     (See  5297).
5308     The  reciprocal  of  the  involute  is  the  hyperbolic  spiral. Proof. — (Fig.  124.)     Let  P'  on  OY  correspond  to  P,  and  let  r',  d'  be  the polar  coordinates  of  P'.     Then  ?•'  =  OP'  = -— -.
But  OY=BP  =  ^vcAB  =  a  (6' +  i,7r),     .■.r'  =  —^—.     See  (5302).
THE  CISSOID.*  (Fig.  125)
5309  Characteristic.  —  A  line  drawn  from  the  end,  0,  of a  fixed  diameter  of  a  circle  to  the  end,  Q,  of  any  perpendicular ordinate  intersects  the  parallel  ordinate  equidistant  from  the centre  in  a  point,  P,  whose  locus  is  the  cissoid.  The  equation of  the  curve  is
fiSlO         tr(2a-v)-a.^'     and     ^(V  _  {6a-2.v)  ^w b6W        y  {^a     .1)  -  a.      ana    -^  -  ^  ^{^a-.vf '
Proof. — By  similar  triangles,  y  :  x  =■  \/{2ax—x-)  :  2a— x.  Two  mean proportionals  between  the  radius  a  and  OS  are  given  by  the  curve,  for  it appears  that  a^  :  GT  '.:  GT  :  GS,  and  therefore  a  :  GT  :  s/CS.GT  :  GS.
5311  The  tangent  of  the  circle  at  B,  the  other  end  of  the diameter,  is  an  asymptote  to  both  branches  of  the  cissoid.
5312  The  area  between  the  curve  and  its  asymptote  is  equal to  three  times  the  area  of  the  circle.

5314  K  a  be  >  m,  there  are  two  ovals,  as  sliown  in  the figure.  In  that  case,  the  last  equation  shows  that  if  OPP' nfeets  the  curve  in  P  and  P',  we  have  OP. OP'  =^{a^—m'^) ; and  therefore  the  curve  is  its  own  inverse  with  respect  to  a circle  of  radius  =  \/(a*— m^).
5315  0  being  the  centre,  the  normal  PG  makes  the  same angle  with  PB  that  OP  does  with  P.l.
Proof.— From  {r  +  dr)(r'  —  dr')  =  vi'  and  r?-'  =  vi^ ;  therefore  rdr'  =  r'dr or  r  :  r'  =  dr  :  dr'  =  sin  0  :  sin  6',  if  6,  d'  be  the  angles  between  the  normal and  r,  r  .     But  OP  divides  APB  in  a  similar  way  in  reverse  order.

If  OB  =  a,  be  the  per- pendicular from  0  upon  the  directrix,  the  equation  of  the curve  with  B  for  the  origin  or  0  for  the  pole  is

Hence,  by  (932),  we  can  draw  the  circle  which  will  cut  AR  in  the  required points  F,  Q.     Thus  any  number  of  points  on  the  oval  may  be  found.

5347  Draw  QG  to  make  Z  BQG  =  BAq;  therefore,  A,  Q,  C,  q being  concyclic,  we  have,  by  (3),
BQ.Bq  =  AB.BC  =  p^   (4).

Hence  C  can  be  found  if  a,  /t,  and  the  points  yl,  B  are given.  G  is  the  third  focus  of  the  ovals,  and  the  equation  of either  oval  may  be  referred  to  any  two  of  the  three  foci.
Putting  BC  =  Ci,  AG  =  c^,  AB  =  c^,  the  equation   between  I,  m,   n  is obtained  from  (4)  thus:  c^Ci{l—fi^)  =  a^—cl;  therefore  Ci(cs  +  Ci)  =  a'  +  frciCy
But  C3  +  C1  =  a„  a  =  — -,  u  =  — ,  and  the  result  is m  m
5348  l'c,-Jrn%  =  m%    or   l'BC-\-m'CA-\-7rAB  =  0...  (5), where  GA  =—AG.
Putting  7',,  r^,  r.j  for  PA,  PB,  PG,  the  equations  of  the curves  arc  as  follows —

That  (6)  and  (7)  are  equations  of  the  curve  has  been  shown.  To  deduce the  other  four,  we  have  Z  APB  =  AqB  =  ACQ  (5347)  ;  therefore  ACQ, APB  are  similar  triangles.  But,  by  (6),  mAP  +  lBP  =  nAB,  therefore mAG+lGQ  =  7iAQ  or  nAQ—WQ  =  mAG,  wliich  is  equation  (9).  Again, ABQ,  APG  are  similar.  But,  by  (7),  mAQ-lBQ  =  nAB ;  therefore mAG-lGP  =  nAP  or  nAP+lGP  =  mAG,  which  is  eqiiation  (8).
Equations  (10)  and  (11)  are  obtained  by  taking  (G)  from  (8)  and  (7) from  (9),  and  employing  (5).
5355  AP.AQ=  AB.AC=  coustaiit.
Proof. — Since  A,  Q,  G,  q  are  concyclic,  Z  QGA  =  QqA  =  ABB ;  there- fore P,  Q,  G,  B  are  concyclic;  therefore  AP.AQ  =  AB.AG  =  constant  (12).
5356  CP.  CP'  =CA.CB  =  constant.
Proof:  Z  PGB  =  PQB  =  Bpq  =  BGq.  Hence,  if  GP  meets  the  inner oval  again  in  P',  GBq,  GBP'  are  similar  triangles.  Again,  because  Z  BPG =  BQG  =  BAq  =  BAP',  the  points  A,  B,  P',  P  are  concyclic  ;  therefore CP.CP'  =GA.GB  =  constant.  Q.  E.  D.
Hence,  by  making  P,  P'  coincide,  we  have  the  theorem  : —
5357  The  tangent  from  the  external  focus  to  a  series  of  tri- confocal  Cartesians  is  of  constant  length,  and  =  ^{GB.GA).

The  proof  is  obtained  from  the  similar  triangles  TQB,  TBQ,  which  show that  sinTQA  :  sin  TQB  =  Z  :  w,  by  (2),  and  from  differentiating  equation  (7),

LINKAGES  AND  LINKWORK.
5400  A  jjk?ir^  linkage,  in  its  extended  sense,  consists  of  a series  of  triangles  in  the  same  plane  connected  by  hinges,  so as  to  have  but  one  degree  of  freedom  of  motion ;  that  is,  if any  two  points  of  the  figure  be  fixed,  and  a  third  point  be made  to  move  in  some  path,  every  other  point  of  the  figure will,  in  general,  also  describe  a  definite  path.  With  two  points actually  fixed,  the  hnkage  is  commonly  called  a  piece-ivorlc, and  if  straight  bars  take  the  place  of  the  triangles,  it  is  called a  linh-iDorlc.
THE   FIVE-BAR   LINKAGE.
5401  Mr.  Kempe's  fundamental  five-bar  linkage  is  shown in  Figure  (135).  A,  B,  D'  are  fixed  pivots  indicated  by  small circles.  G,  I),  B',  C ,  in  the  same  plane,  are  moveable  pivots indicated  by  dots.  The  lengths  of  the  bars  AB,  BG,  GD,  DA are  denoted  by  a,  b,  c,  d.  The  lengths  of  AB\  B'G\  G'D',  D'A are  proportional  to  the  former,  and  are  equal  to  ha,  kh,  kc,  Jed, respectively.  Hence  ABGD,  AB'G'D'  are  similar  quadri- laterals, and  A  AUG'  =  ADG.  P  being  any  assigned  point on  BG  and    />'P  =  X,    F'  must   be  taken   on   D'G'   so    that
D'F'  =  A  — .     Draw  FN,  F'N'  perpendiculars  to  AB.     Then,
ah throughout  the  motion  of  the  linkage  in  one  plane,  NN'  is  a constant  length.
Proof:  NN' =  ]}D'-(BN+N'D').     But  BB' =  a-U,  and
BN+N'B'  =  \  cos B-\ '^  cos  B-^(2ah  cos B-2ccl cosD) ah  'lab
=  _A_ („'^  +  h^ -  c^ - d')  (702).   Hence 2ab

5403  Case  I. -(Fig.  136.)  If  A  =  ^(^^;M)_^,  then NN'  =  -^ ;  consequently,  if  tlie  bars  PO  =  BB  and  F'O  = F'B'  be  added,  the  point  0  will  move  in  the  line  AB.
If,  in  this  case,  d  =  ha  and  h  =  c,  then  X  =  h  and  F  coin- cides with  G,  P'  with  C,  and  B'  with  D,  0  as  before  moving in  the  line  AB.
5404  Case  IL  —  (Fig.  137.)  If,  in  Case  I.,  M  =  a  and a^-\-J)^  ^  c^^(p^  X  is  indeterminate;  that  is,  P  may  then  be taken  anywhere  on  BG.     D'  coincides  with  B,  and  NN'  =  0.
PP'  is  now  always  perpendicular  to  AB.  If  the  bars  PO, P'O  be  added,  of  lengths  such  that  PO^-P'0'~  =  PB--P'B\ 0  will  move  in  the  line  AB.  If,  on  the  other  side  of  PP' ,  bars P0'=  P'B  and  P'O'  =  PB  be  attached,  then  0'  will  move  in  a perpendicular  to  AB  through  B.
5405  Case  III.— (Fig.  138.)     If,  in  Case  I.,  U  =  «,  h  =  d,
and  G  =  —  a,  the  figure  A  BCD  is  termed  a  contra-parallelogram.
BP  =  X   is  indeterminate,    BC'=hc  =  -'^^^  and  BP' = -X.
Hence  BG'  and  BP'  are  measured  in  a  reversed  direction ; PP'  is  always  perpendicular  to  AB,  and  if  any  two  equal  bars PO,  P'O  are  added,  0  Avill  move  in  the  line  AB.
5406  If  three  or  more  similar  contra-parallelograms  be added  to  the  linkage  in  this  way,  as  in  Figure  (139),  having the  common  pivot  B  and  the  bars  BA,  BG,  BE,  BG  in  geo- metrical progression ;  then,  if  the  bars  BA,  BG  are  set  to  any angle,  the  other  bars  will  divide  that  angle  into  three  or  more equal  parts.
5407  If,  in  Figure  (138),  AD  be  fixed  and  DG  describe  an angle  ADG,  then  B'G'  describes  an  equal  angle  in  the  opposite direction.  Mr,  Kempe  terms  such  an  arrangement  a  recersor, and  the  linkage  in  Figure  (139)  a  multiplicator.    With  the  aid
734  THEORY  OF  PLANE  CURVES.
of  these,  and  with  a  translator  (Fig.  140),  for  moving  a  bar AB  anywhere  parallel  to  itself,  he  shows  that  any  plane  curve of  the  7^*''  degree  may,  theoretically,  be  constructed  by  link- work.*
5408  Case  IV.  — (Fig.  141.)  If,  in  the  original  linkage (Fig.  135)  M  =  a,  D'  coincides  with  B.  Then,  if  the  bars BPO,  RP'O'  be  added  by  pivots  at  P,  F,  and  B ;  and  if OP  =  PB  =  BP'  and  O'P'  =  P'B  =  BP  ;  the  points  0,  0' will  move  in  perpendiculars  to  AB.  For  by  projecting  the equal  lines  upon  AB,  we  get  jVL  =  BN'  and  BN  =  N'L\ therefore  BL  =  BL'  =  NN'  =  a  constant,  by  (5402).
5409  Case  V.— (Fig.  142.)  Make  ha  =  d  and  X  =  h.  Then B'  coincides  witli  D,  P  with  G,  and  P'  with  G'.  Replace  B'G\ G'D  by  tlie  bars  DK,  KD'  equal  and  parallel  to  the  former. Also  add  the  bars  GO  =  DK  and  OK  =  CD.  Draw  the  per- pendiculars from  0,  G  and  G'  to  AB.  Then  by  projection, NL  =  N'D' ;  therefore  BL  =  BN+NL  =  BN+N'U  =  BD' —3/7V"'=  constant.  Hence  the  point  0  will  move  perpendi- cularly to  AB.
5410  Case  VI.— (Fig.  143.)  In  the  last  case  take  k  =  l. Therefore  d  =  a,  U  coincides  with  ,Z?,  BK  =  BG,  and  GDKO is  a  rhombus.     This  is  Peaucellier's  linkage.
5411  Casi^  VII. — (Fig.  144.)  In  the  fundamental  linkage (Fig.  135),  transfer  the  fixed  pivots  from  A,  B  to  P,  8,  adding the  bar  ^S^,  so  that  PBHA  shall  be  a  parallelogram.  Then, since  NN'  is  Constant  (5  102),  the  point  P'  will  move  perpen- dicularly to  the  fixed  line  PS.
5412  Join  AG  cutting  PS  in  Z7,  and  draw  UV  parallel  to  AD. Then  UV  :  AD  =  PU  :  AB  =  GP  :  GB  =  constant  ;  there- fore P?7  and  f/Fare  constant  lengths.  Hence  it  follows  that the  parallelism  of  AB  to  itself  may  be  secured  by  a  fixed  pivot at  U  and  a  bar  UV  instead  of  the  pivot  S  and  bar  SA.
5413  In  Case  VII.  (Fig.  144),  with  fixed  pivots  P  and  8
*  Froc.  of  the  Loud.  Math.  Soc,  Vol.  vii.,  p.  213.
LINKAGES  AND  LINKWOBK.  735
and  bar  SA,  make  h  =  a,  d  =  c,  ha  =  d,  \  =  h.  Then  B'  coin- cides with  D,  N'  with  N,  F  with  G  and  L,  and  F'  with  G' ; and  we  have  Figure  145,  DG,  DG'  are  equal,  and  they  are equally  inclined  to  AB  or  G8;  because,  in  similar  quadri- laterals, it  is  obvious  that  AB  and  GD  and  the  homologous sides  DG'  and  AD'  include  equal  angles.  Therefore  GG'  is perpendicular  to  GS,  and  G'  moves  in  that  perpendicular  only.
5414  If  two  equal  hnkages  like  that  in  (5413),  Figure  (145), but  with  the  bars  AS,  GS  removed,  be  joined  at  D  (Fig.  146) and  constructed  so  that  GDy,  jDG'  form  two  rigid  bars,  then AB,  a|3  will  always  be  in  one  straight  hue.  Let  A,  B  be  made fixed  pivots,  then,  while  G  describes  a  circle,  the  motion  of the  bar  oj3  will  be  that  of  a  carpenter's  plane.
5415  On  the  other  hand,  if  the  linkage  of  Figure  (145),  with AS  and  GS  removed  as  before,  be  united  to  a  similar  inverted Hnkage  (Fig.  147),  with  DG,  DG'  common,  then,  with  fixed pivots  A,  B,  D',  the  motion  of  the  bar  a/3  will  be  that  of  a  Hft, directly  to  and  from  AB.
5416  The  crossing  of  the  Hnks  may  be  obviated  by  the arrangement  in  Figure  (148).  Here  the  bars  (7'/3,  G'D,  G'D' are  removed,  and  the  bars  FD,  FE,  FG  added  in  parallel  ruler fashion.
5417  Case  YIII.— (Fig.  149.)  In  Case  YIL,  substitute  the pivot  TJ  and  the  bar  UV  for  S  and  SA.  Make  d  =  a,  and therefore  Jv  =  l.  Then  h' =  b  and  c  =  c,  making  BGDG'  a contra-parallelogram ;  D'  coincides  with  B,  and  B'  with  D. The  bars  AB,  AD  are  now  superfluous.     Take  BF  =  X;  then
BF'  =  X  f ;  therefore  FF'  is  parallel  to  GG',  therefore  to  BD,
h therefore  to  FV  (5412) ;  therefore  V,  F,  F'  are_ always  in  one right  line.     F' ,  as  in  Case  VII.,  moves  perpendicularly  \>oFV and  AB.     This  arrangement  is  Hart's  ^i;e-Z>ar  Unhage.
5418  When  a  point  F  (Fig.  152)  moves  in  a  right  line  FS, it  is  easy  to  connect  to  P  a  linkage  which  will  make  another point  move  in  any  other  given  line  we  please  in  the  same

plane.  Let  QR  he  sucla  a  line  cutting  PS  in  Q.  Make  Q  a fixed  pivot,  and  let  0(2,  OF,  OB  be  equal  bars  on  a  free  pivot 0.  Then,  if  the  angle  FOR  be  kept  constant  by  the  tie-bar Fll,  FQB,  being  one  half  of  FOB  (Euc.  iii.  21),  will  also  be constant,  and  therefore,  while  F  describes  one  line,  B  describes the  other.
If  the  bar  FO  carries  a  plane  along  with  it,  every  point  in that  plane  on  the  circumference  of  the  circle  FQB  will  move in  a  right  line  passing  through  Q.
THE   SIX-BAR  INVERTOR  *
5419  If  in  the  linkwork  (5410,  Fig.  143)  the  bar  AD  be removed,  and  D  be  made  to  describe  any  curve,  0  will  describe the  inverse  curve,  just  as,  when  D  described  a  circle,  0  moved in  a  right  line  which  is  the  inverse  of  a  circle.
Proof.— Let  BOD  and  CK  intersect  in  E.     Then  BO.OD  =  BE- - OE' =  BG-  —  OC^-  =  a  constant  called  the  mochilus  of  the  cell.
THE  EIGHT-BAR  DOUBLE  INVERTOR.
5420  Two  jointed  rhombi  (Fig.  150)  having  a  common diameter  AB  form  a  double  Peaucellier  cell  termed  positive or  negative  according  as  P  or  Q  is  made  the  fulcrum.  We have  P(2.PB  =  PQ.Q8  =  AP^-AQ\  the  constant  modulus of  the  cell.
THE  FOUR-BAR  DOUBLE  INVERTOR.
5421  If,  on  the  bars  of  a  contra -parallelogram  ABCD (Fig.  151)  four  points  j),  q,  r,  s  be  taken  in  a  line  parallel  to Ac  or  BD,  then  in  every  deformation  of  the  linkage,  the points  2h  <h  '■'  ^  ^^ill  ^ic  in  a  right  line  parallel  to  AG ;  and pq  .pr  =  pq  .  q,^  =  a  constant  modulus.  Thus,  if  _p  be  a  ful- crum and  r  describes  a  curve,  q  will  describe  the  inverse curve.    If  q  be  the  fulcrum,  j?  will  describe  the  inverse  curve.
Proof. — Let   Ap  =  mAB,    therefore  pq  =  mBD,   &nd  pr  =  (I  — m)  AG, thereiore pq.pr  =  m  (1— w)  AG.BD  =  m  (l—m)(AD'—AB-)  =  constant.
*  Since  the  curve  described  is  the  inverse  and  not  the  i^olar  reciprocal  of  the  guiding  curve, it  seems  bettor  to  call  this  linkage  an  invtrtor  rather  than  a  reciprocator.
LINKAGES  AND  LtNKWOEK.  737
THE  QUADRUPLANE,  OR  VERSOR  INVERTOR. 5422  Let  the  bars  of  the  contra-parallelogram  invertor (5421,  Fig.  151)  carry  planes,  and  let  P,  Q,  B,  S  be  points  in the  planes  similarly  situated  with  respect  to  the  bars  which contain  p,  q,  r,  s  respectively,  so  that  /.PAp  =  QA<i  and AP  :  Ap  =  AQ  :  Aq;  and  similarly  at  G.  Then,  if  P  be  the fulcrum  and  B  traces  a  curve,  Q  will  trace  the  inverse  curve and  the  angle  QPB  will  be  constant.
PjjOof. — Let  PA  =  nAB  and  PB  =  n'AB,  therefore,  by  similar  triangles, PAQ,  BAD,  PQ  =  nBD.     Also,  by  the  triangles  PBU,  ABG,   PB  =  n'AG ;
PA    PTi therefore  PQ.PB  -  nn'AG.BD  =  ^^j~- (AD' - AB') ,  a  constant.
Again,  the  inclination  of  PQ  to  BD  =  that  of  AP  to  AB,  which  is  con- stant. Similarly,  by  the  triangles  PBB,  ABG,  the  inclination  of  PB  to  AG =  that  of  BB  to  BG,  which  is  also  constant ;  therefore  QPB,  the  sum  of these  two  inclinations,  is  a  constant  angle.
THE  PENTOGRAPH,  OR  PROPORTIONATOR.
5423  Let  ABGD  (Fig.  153)  be  a  jointed  parallelogram,  J,  B fixed  pivots,  q  a  tracer  placed  at  any  assigned  point  in  BG produced ;  then  a  pencil  at  p  will  evidently  reproduce  any figure  traced  by  q  diminished  in  linear  proportions  in  the  ratio of  Bq  to  BG.
THE  PLAGIOGRAPH,  OR  VERSOR  PROPORTIONATOR.
5424  In  the  same  figure,  make  an  angle  qBQ  =  pBP, BQ  =  Bq,  and  DP  =  Dp,  and  let  a  tracer  Q  and  pencil  P  be rigidly  connected  to  the  arms  BG  and  DG.  Then  P  will  pro- duce a  similar  reduced  figure  as  before,  but  no  longer  similarly situated.  It  will  be  turned  round  through  an  angle  QBq. This  is  Prof.  Sylvester's  Plagiograph.
Proof.— Let  BG  =  h.Bq',  therefore  AD  =  kBQ,  DP  =  kAB,  and  Z  ABQ =  PDA  ;  therefore  (Euc.  vi.  6)  AP  =  hAQ.  Also  PAQ  is  a  constant  angle, for  PAQ  =  BAD-BAQ-PAD  =  BAD-BAQ-BQA  =  BAD- (n- ABQ) =  BAD-TT  +  ABG+QBq  =  QBq.
THE  ISOKLINOSTAT,*  OR  ANGLE-DIVIDER.
5425  This  linkage  (Fig.  154)  accomplishes  the  division  of an  angle  into  any  desired  number  of  equal  parts.     The  dia-

gram  shows  the  trisection  of  an  angle  by  it.  A  number  of equal  bars  are  hinged  together  end  to  end,  and  also  pivoted on  their  centres  to  the  same  number  of  equal  bars  which radiate,  fan-like,  from  a  common  pivot.  The  alternate  radial bars  make  equal  angles  with  each  other.
The  same  thing  is   accomplished  in  a  different   way  by Kempe's  Multiplicator  (5406,  Fig.  139).
A  LINKAGE  FOR  DRAWING  AN  ELLIPSE.
5426  In  the  arrangement  of  (5413,  Fig.  145)  the  locus  of any  point  P,  on  DC,  excepting  D  and  G',  is  an  ellipse.
Proof. — Take  08,  00'  for  x  and  y  axes ;  P  the  point  xy  ;   SOB  —  0, and    therefore     ODC'  =  29;    PD  =  h.       Then    we    have    x  =  (c—h)cosO,
y  =  (c  +  h)  sinO,  therefore        ^        +       -^      .^  =  1  is  the  equation  of  the  locus.
(^C  —  ll)  i^C-Tll)"
Any  point  on  a  plane  carried  by  DC  also  describes  an  ellipse  round  0 ;  but if  the  point  lies  on  a  circle  whose  centre  is  D  and  radius  DO,  the  ellipse  be- comes a  right  line  passing  through  0,  as  appears  from  (5418).
A  LINKAGE  FOR  DRAWING  A  LIMAQON,  AND  ALSO  A BICIRCULAR  QUARTIC.*
5427  (Fig.  155.)  Let  four  bars  AF,  AQ\  BG,  GD  be pivoted  at  A,  B,  G,  D,  and  let  AB  =  BG  =  BQ' =  a ;  AD =  DG  =  DP'  =  6.  Take  a  fulcrum  F  on  BG,  a  tracer  at  P, and  a  follower  at  Q,  so  that  PQ  is  parallel  to  BD.  Let  FP  =  p, FQ  =  r;  then,  if  P  traces  out  a  circle  passing  through  F,  Q will  describe  a  lima9on.
Proof.— Let  BQ  =  ma,  therefore  PD  =  mh  ;  r  =  2?u .  BN,  p  =  {m.  + 1) .  DN +  (1  -  m)  BN.  Also  BN^  -  DN^  =o?-  h\  Eliminate  BN  and  DN,  and  the equation  between  r  and  p  is
r+(l  — m)  rp  —  mp^  =  m  (ju  +  l)'- (ci'  —  b-)  =  A;^ If  P  describes  the  circle   p  =  c  cos  0,   Q  describes  the  locus r"+  (1  —  m)  cr  cos  B  —  mc-  cos'-  Q  =  Zr, which  is  the  inverse  of  a  conic,  that  is,  a  limayon  (5327).
If  0  be  made  the  fulcrum,  the  equation  reduces  to   r—p^  =  4  (a-  —  h-).

5430  If  a  triangle  ABG  (Fig.  157)  be  connected  by  the bars  AO,  BO'  to  the  fulcra  0,  &,  the  locus  of  G  is  called  a three-bar  curve.
OA,  O'B  meet  in  Q,  the  instantaneous  centre  of  rotation  of the  triangle,  since  QA.,  QB  are  perpendicular  to  the  movements of  J  and  B  respectively.  Therefore  GQ  is  the  normal  to  the locus  of  G.
5431  If  a  triangle  similar  to  ABG  be  placed  upon  00' (homologous  to  AB),  the  circum-circle  of  the  triangle  will pass  through  the  node,  and  the  vertices  of  the  triangle  are called  the  foci  of  the  curve.

MECHANICAL   CALCULATORS.
The  Mechanical  Integrator. i
5450  This  instrument  computes  not  only  the  area  of  any closed  plane  curve,  but  the  moment  and  also  the  moment  of inertia  of  the  area  about  a  fixed  line.  The  principle  of  its action  is  shown  in  Figure  (160).  OP  is  a  bar  carrying  a tracer  at  P,  and  a  roller  J  at  some  point  of  its  length.  The end  0  is  constrained  to  move  in  the  fixed  line  ON.  When the  tracer  P  moves  round  a  closed  curve,  the  length  OP  mul- tiplied by  the  entire  advance  recorded  by  the  roller  is  equal  to the  area  of  the  curve.
Proof. —  Let  the  motion  of  the  tracer  from  P  to  a  consecutive  point  Q  be decomposed  into  PP'  and  P'(2  parallel  and  perpendicular  to  ON.  Let OP  =  a  and  PON  =  6.  When  the  pointer  moves  from  P  to  P',  the  roll accomplished  is  PP'  sin  6.  The  roll  due  to  the  motion  from  P'  to  Q  will  be neutralized  by  the  exactly  equal  and  opposite  roll  in  the  motion  of  the  pointer from  q  to  ^j',  since  the  bar  will  there  have  again  the  same  inclination.  Con- sequently the  product  of  the  entire  roll  and  the  length  a  is  equal  to  the  sum of  such  terms  as  aPP'  sin  d.  But  this  is  the  area  OPP'O'  =  NPP'N'.  The algebraic  addition  of  such  rectangles  gives  the  entire  area,  and  the  instru- ment effects  this,  for  the  area  SN  is  subtracted,  by  the  motion  of  the  roller, from  the  area  QN  which  is  added.
5451  The  instrument  itself  is  shown  in  Figure  (161).  A frame  moving  parallel  to  OX  by  means  of  the  guide  BB carries  two  equal  horizontal  wheels  geared  to  a  central  wheel which  has  two  circumferences,  such  that  its  rate  of  angular motion  is  half  that  of  the  lower  wheel  and  one  third  of  that  of the  upper.  The  latter  wheels  carry  two  rollers,  M  and  I,  on horizontal  axles ;  and  the  middle  wheel  carries  an  arm  OP,  a pointer  at   P,  and  a  roller  A.     In  the  initial  position,  the

t  Invented  and  manufactured  by  Mr.  J.  Amsler-Laflbn,  of  Schaflfhauson.  The  demon- strations (which  in  clearness  and  elegance  cannot  bo  surpassed)  of  the  action  of  this  instru- ment, and  of  the  rianimetcr  which  follows,  were  communicated  to  the  author  by  Mr.  J. Macfarlane  Gray,  of  the  Board  of  Trade.

rollers  J  and  /are  parallel,  while  M  is  at  right  angles  to  A. The  frame  is  thus  supported  above  the  paper  on  the  three rollers ;  and  if  the  arm  OP  be  moved  through  an  angle  AOA', the  axles  of  the  rollers  M  and  I  will  describe  twice  and  three times  that  angle  respectively.  Putting  OP  =  a  as  above,  and A,  My  and  I  for  the  linear  circumferential  advances  recorded by  the  three  equal  rollers  respectively,  we  have  the  following results —
I. — The  area  traced  out  by  the  pointer  P  =  Aa.
II. — The  moment  of  the  area  about  OX       =  M
a-
III. — The  moment  of  inertia  about  OX  =  (3^4  +  /)--.
Proof. — I.  Since  0  moves  in  the  line  OX,  while  the  pointer  P  moves  round a  curve,  the  roller  A  will,  as  shown  above,  make  the  rolling  2A.  sin  6,  where Ji  =  PP'  in  Figure  (160),  and  the  area  of  the  curve  =  a'^h  sin  0  or  a  X  roll.
II.  The  moment  of  the  area  about  OX
=  2  (a/i  sin  0  X  ^^^)  = -^  (2/i-2/i  cos  2^).
Now  2A  vanishes  when  P  returns  to  the  starting  point,  and  —  2/;  cos  2d  is  the roll  recorded  by  M.  For,  when  OP  makes  an  angle  0  with  OX,  the  axis  of 31  will  make  an  angle  —  (90^  +  26)  with  OX.  In  this  position,  while  P  makes  a parallel  movement  h,  the  roll  produced  thereby  in  M  will  be  —h  sin  (90° +  2^)
=  —Ji  COS  20.      Therefore   —  X  roll  of  M  =  moment  of  area. 4
III.  Lastly,  the  moment  of  inertia  of  the  area  about  OX
=  :^( ah  sin  ex^-~^\  =  ~%{Shsind-hsm^d).
Now,  when  OP  makes  an  angle  6  with  OX,  the  axis  of  I  makes  —30 ;  there- fore —  2/t  sin  30  is  the  entire  roll  of  I.     Hence  the  moment  of  inertia
=  -^  X  roll  oiA+^x  roll  of  I. 4  12

5452  This  instrument  *  is  a  simpler  form  of  area  computer. 0  is  a  fixed  pivot ;  OA,  AP  are  two  rods  having  a  free  pivot at  ^ ;  (7  is  the  roller,  and  P  the  pointer.  The  area  of  a  closed curve  traced  by  the  pointer  is  equal  to  the  total  roll  multiplied by  the  length  AP.
*  Like  The  Integrator,  the  invention  of  Mr.  Amsler.
742  TREOBY  OF  PLANE  CURVES.
Proof. — Decompose  the  elementary  motion  PQ  of  the  pointer  into  PP', effected  with  a  constant  radius  OP,  and  P'Q  ah^ig  the  radius  OP',  and  so  all round  the  curve.  The  roll  of  G  accomplished  while  P  moves  from  P'  to  Q will  be  neutralized  by  the  equal  contrary  roll  when  P  moves  from  q  to  j:)'  on the  radius  Op'  =  OP.  Thus  the  total  roll  recorded  will  be  the  sum  of  the rolls  due  to  the  movements  PP',  QQ',  &c.
Draw  OB  perpendicular  to  AP,  and,  when  P  comes  to  P,  let  B'  be  the altered  position  of  B.  The  area  PQSP  =  \{0P--  OR-)  w,  where  u,  =  POQ. But  0P^=  0 A' +  PA- -2PA.AG-2PA.bg  (Euc.  ii.  13)  ;  therefore,  since BG  is  the  only  varying  length  on  the  right,  we  have  PQSR  =  PA{BG^BG')u). But  BGio  is  the  roll  of  G  due  to  the  angular  motion  w  of  the  rigid  frame  OAP, and  the  subtraction  of  the  area  OSR  from  0P(^  is  effected  by  the  instrument, since  when  the  pointer  moves  from  8  to  R  the  direction  of  the  roll  must  be reversed.     Hence  the  total  area  =  PA  x  the  total  recorded  roll.

SYSTEMS   OF   COORDINATES.
CARTESIAN  OR  THREE -PLANE  COORDINATES.
5501  The  position  of  a  point  P  in  this  system  (Fig.  168)  is determined  by  its  distances,  x  =  PA,  y  =  PB,  z  =  PC,  from three  fixed  planes  YOZ,  ZOX,  XOY,  the  distances  being measured  parallel  to  the  mutual  intersections  OX,  OY,  OZ  of the  planes,  which  intersections  constitute  the  axes  of  coordi- nates. The  point  P  is  referred  to  as  the  point  xyz,  and  in the  drawing  x,  y,  %  are  all  reckoned  positive,  ZOX  being  the plane  of  the  paper  and  P  being  situated  in  front  of  it,  to  the right  of  YOZ  and  above  XOY.  If  P  be  taken  on  the  other side  of  any  of  these  planes,  its  coordinate  distance  from  that plane  is  reckoned  negative.
FOUR.PLANE  COORDINATES.
5502  In  this  system  the  position  of  a  point  is  determined by  four  coordinates  a,  j3,  y,  I,  which  are  its  perpendicular distances  from  four  fixed  planes  constituting  a  tetrahedron  of reference.  The  system  is  in  Solid  Geometry  precisely  what trilinear  coordinates  are  in  Plane.  The  relation  between  the coordinates  of  a  point  corresponding  to  (4007)  in  trilinears  is
5503  ^a+i^yg+Cy+DS  =  3F,
where  A,B,G,D  are  the  areas  of  the  faces  of  the  tetrahedron of  reference,  and  V  is  its  volume.
TETRAHEDRAL  COORDINATES.

POLAR  COORDINATES.
5506  Let  0  be  the  origin  (Fig.  168),  XOZ  the  plane  of reference  in  rectangular  coordinates,  then  the  polar  coordi- nates of  a  point  P  are  r,  B,  (/>,  such  that  r  =  OP,  0  =  LPOZ^ and  0  =  Z  XOO  between  the  planes  of  X^OZ  and  POZ.
THE   RIGHT   LINE.
5507  The  coordinates  of  the  point  dividing  in  a  given  ratio the  distance  between  two  given  points  are  as  in  (4032),  with  a similar  value  for  the  third  coordinate  t-
5508  The  distance  P,  Q  between  the  two  points  xijz^  x'y'z  is
PQ  =^{(^aj-w'f^-{y-yj^-{z-^j}.  (Euc.i.47).

Proof. — Let  P,  Q  be  the  points,  0  the  origin.  Describe  a  sphere  cutting OF,  OQ  in  1J,C  and  the  z  axis  in  A;  then,  by  (702),  PQ- =  OF'+OQ^ —  20P.  OQ  cos  FOQ  and  cos  POQ,  or  cos  a  in  the  spherical  triangle  ABC,  is given  by  formula  (882),  since  b  =  6,  c  =  d',  and  A  =  <p  —  <p'.

The  angles  PQL,  PQM,  PQN  are  denoted  by  a,  j3,  y ;  and  the angles  YOZ,  ZOX,  XOY  between  the  axes  by  X,  in,  v.
5513  When  X,  ^,  v  are  right  angles,  the  axes  are  called rectangular,  and  the  direction -ratios  are  called  direction- cosines,  being  in  that  case  severally  equal  to  cos  a,  cos/3, cosy.
5514  When  L,  M,  N  are  the  direction-ratios  (or  numbers proportional  to  them)  of  a  line  which  passes  through  a  point abc,  the  line  may  be  referred  to  as  the  line  {LMN,  ale),  or,  if direction  only  is  concerned,  merely  the  line  LMN.
EQUATIONS  BETWEEN  THE  CONSTANTS  OF  A  LINE.
5515  The  relation   between   the  constants  of  a  line  with rectangular  axes  is

5516  /  cos a+m  cos /8+71  cosy  =  1.

And  this  will  also be  equal  to  the  projection  of  the  bent  line  QLCP,  upon  I'm'n,  for,  if planes  be  drawn  through  Q,  L,  C,  and  P,  at  right  angles  to  the  second  line I'm'n,  the  segment  on  that  line  intercepted  between  the  first  and  last  plane will  be  =  QP  cosQ,  and  the  three  segments  which  compose  this  will  be severally  equal  to  QL .1' ,  LG.m,  CP.n,  the  projections  of  QL,  LG,  GP. Then,  by  (5512),   QL  =  QP.l,  &c.

Here  abc  is  a  datum  point  on  the  line,  and  if  r  be  put  for  the value  of  each  of  the  fractions,  r  is  the  distance  to  a  variable point  xyz.     L,  M,  N  are  proportional  to  the  direction  ratios  of

5525  Note. — Instead  of  <x,  b,  c  in  the  equation  we  may  use IcL  +  a^  ]cM-\-b,  Jd  +  c,  where  h  is  an  arbitrary  constant.
5526  The  equations  of  a  line  may  also  be  written  in  the forms  .1'  =  \z-\-a,         y  =  iiz-\-^.
5527  These  are  the  equations  of  the  traces  on  the  planes  of xz  and  yz,  and  are  equivalent  to
A -a  _  ;/-/8  _  £-0 X     ~     ^     ~     1    ■
5528  If  the  line  is  determined  as  the  intersection  of  the  two planes  Ax-{-Bij-{-Cz  =  D  and  A'xi-B'y  +  C'z  =  V,  we  may write  equations  (5523)  by  taking
L  =  BC'-B'C,     M=  CA'-C'A,     N=  AB-A'B,
DB'-D'B        ^       DA-DA

Proof.  —  Eliminate  z  between  the  equations  of  the  planes,    then  the reciprocals  of  the  coefficients  of  x  and  y  will  be  L  and  M.
5529  The  projection  of  the  line  joining  the  points  xyz  and ahc  upon  the  line  Imn  is
I  {.v-a)-{-7n  (y—b)+n  (z—c).
5530  Hence,  when  the  line  passes  through  ahc,  the  square of  the  perpendicular  from  xyz  upon  it  is  equal  to

Proof. — Eliminate  x,  y,  z  between  the  equations
X — a  _  y  —  h  _  z  —  c_  ■,     x  —  a'_y  —  h'_z  —  c       /
by  subtracting  in  pairs,  and  then  eliminate  r  and  r' .
5534  The  shortest  distance  between  the  same  lines  is
{a-a'){M}^'-M'N)^{h-h'){NL'-N'L)-\-{c-c'){LM'-L'M) ^{{MN'-M'NY-^{NL'-N'LY-\-{LM'-L'My\
Pkoof. — Assume  A,  n,  v  for  the  div-cos.  of  the  shortest  distance.  Then, by  projecting  the  line  joining  ahc,  a'h'c  upon  the  shortest  distance,  we  get pz=z  {^a-a)\  +  ih-l')  ix  +  {G  —  c')y.  Also,  by  (5520),  iX  +  iU/x  +  iV.' =  0  and L'X  +  M'n  +  N'v  =  0,  giving  the  ratios  X  :  /n  :  y  =  MN'—M'N :  NL'—N'L :  LM'—L'M;  and  (5524)  then  gives  the  values  of  \,  n,  v.
5535  The  equation  of  the  line  of  shortest  distance  between the  lines  {Imn,  ahc)  and  {I'lii'ii ,  a'h'c)  is  given  by  the  inter- section of  the  two  planes

where  it  =  I  {a'  —  a)-\-m  {b'  —  h)-\-n  {c'  —  c),
u'=I'(a  —  a')-{-  m'  {b  —  h')  +  n  {c  —  c) ,
and  cos  6  =  11' -{-nini' -\- nn' .
Proof. — (Fig.  170.)  Let  0  be  the  point  xyz  on  the  line  of  shortest  dis- tance AB ;  P,  Q  the  points  abc,  a'h'c  on  the  given  lines  AP,  BQ.  Draw  BR and  PR  parallel  to  AP  and  AB  ;  RT  perpendicular  to  BQ  ;  and  QN,  TM  per- pendicular to  BR.  Then  Z  RBQ  =  d,  RN  =  u,  QT  =  «',  therefore  NM =  u'cosi6  and  RM  =  RN+NM  =  7t  +  u' cos  6,  and  in  the  right-angled  tri- angle RTB,  RM  cosGc^d  =  RB,  the  projection  of  OP  upon  AP,  that  is,  the

5536  Otherwise,  the  line  of  shortest  distance  is  the  inter- section of  the  two  planes  whose  equations  are

^    I  (.r- (Q  +  m  {ii-h')-\-n  (z-c) i  {.V  —  a)-\- m  {y — h') -\-n  {z  —  c) '
For  these  equations  state  that  cos  0  is  the  ratio  of  the  projections  of  OP or  of  OQ  upon  the  given  lines,  and  this  fact  is  apparent  from  the  figure.

Proof. — The  condition  of  perpendicularity  to  Inm  is
Ll  +  Mvi  +  Nn  =  0;  (5520)
and  the  condition  of  intersecting  the  line  is
(a-a)(iMn-mN)  +  {b-b')(Nl-iiL)  +  (c-c')(Lm-m)  =  0. These  equations  determine  the  ratios  L  :  M  :  N.

5583  The  general  equation  is

CYLINDRICAL  AND   CONICAL    SURFACES.
5590  Def. — A  conical  surface  is  generated  by  a  right  line which  passes  through  a  fixed  point  called  the  vertex  and moves  in  any  manner.
5591  If  the  point  be  at  infinity,  the  line  moves  always parallel  to  itself  and  generates  a  cylindrical  surface.
5592  Any  section  of  the  surface  by  a  plane  may  be  taken for  the  guiding  curve.
5593  To  find  the  equation  of  a  cylindrical  or  conical  surface.
Rule. — EJiininojte  xyz  from  tlie  equations  of  the  guiding curve  and  the  equations  ^^  =  llzE  =  —  of  any  generating

CIRCULAR  SECTIONS.
5596  Rule. — To  find  the  circular  sections  of  a  qaadrlc  curve, express  the  equation  in  the  form  A  (x'^  +  /  +  z'^  +  c^)-t-&c.  =  0. If  the  remaining  terms  can  be  resolved  into  tivo  factors,  the circular  sections  are  defined  by  the  intersection  of  a  sphere  and two  planes.
5597  Generally  the  two  quadrics

Pkoof.— Let  r,  p  be  coincident  radii  of  the  two  surfaces  having  hm  for  a
common    direction.       Then  —  =  aP  +  h»r  + or +  2fmn  +  2gnli-2Mm   and  — r  P

h^(x''  +  y^  +  z'-c")  =  z  {2ahx  +  (h''  +  c''-n')  z-2hc''}, and  therefore  the  cone  has  two  series  of  parallel  circular  sections,  z  =  h  and 2abx  +  {b^  +  c''-a^)  z-2bc^  =  f   (5583).  {Frost  and  WolstenlxolmeS)
CONICOIDS.
5599     Defs.— A  conicold  is  a  surface  every  plane  section  of which  is  a  conic.
The  varieties  are  the  ellipsoid,  the  one-fold  and  two-fold hyperbololds,  the  eUlptic  and  hyperbolic  _  paraboloids,  the spheroid  of  revolution,  the  cone,  and  the  cylinder.

762  SOLID  GEOMETRY.
In  any  of  the  following  equations  of  a  conicoid,  by  making  one  of  the variables  constant,  the  equation  of  a  section  parallel  to  a  coordinate  plane  is obtained,  and  the  equation  of  the  surface  is  by  that  means  verified.  Thus, in  the  equations  of  (5600)  or  (5617),  Figs.  (172)  and  (173),  if  z  be  put =  ON,  we  get  the  equation  of  the  elliptic   section  BPQ,  the  semi-axes  of
which  are  NQ  =  -  V(c'-ON')  and  NR  =  ^y{c'-ON%  a,  b,  c  being  the
c  c
principal  semi-axes  of  the  conicoid ;   that  is,  OA,  OB,  OC  in  the  figure.
THE   ELLIPSOID.
5600  The  equation  referred  to  tlie  principal  axes  of  the figure  is

5601  There  are  two  planes  of  circular  section  whose equations  are
with  ayhyc.
is  a  cone  having  a  common  section  with  the  conicoid  and  a  sphere  of  radius r.  If  the  common  section  be  plane,  one  of  the  three  terms  must  vanish in  order  that  the  rest  may  be  resolved  into  two  factors.
Since  a  >b  >  c,   the  only   possible    solution    for   real   factors   is   got  by making  r  =  b.
5602  Sections  by  planes  parallel  to  the  above  are  also circles,  and  any  other  sections  are  ellipses.
5603     The  umbilici  of  the  ellipsoid  (see  -■)777)  are  the  points whose  coordinates  are
V  u—r  ^  tr—e"
Proof. — The  points  of  intersection  of  the  planes  (56' >1)  and  the  ellipsoid
(5600)  on   the  xz  plane  are  given  by  x  =  =b  a  *  /  ''.,       .„  2'  =  ±  c  \    —   r,  •
Since,  by  (5602)  the  vanishing  circular  sections  are  at  the  points  in  the  xs plane  conjugate  to  x   and  2',  we  have,  by  (4352),  x  =■   -■/,  z  =      x  .

5604  If  a  =  h,  in  (5600),  the  figure  becomes  a  spheroid,  and every  plane  parallel  to  tij  makes  a  circular  section.  Hence the  spheroid  is  a  surface  of  revolution.  It  is  called  prolate or  oblate  according  as  the  ellipse  is  made  to  revolve  about  its major  or  minor  axis.
THE  HYPERBOLOID.

SPHERO-CONICS.
Def. — A  splicro-conic  is  the  curve  of  intersection  of  the surface  of  a  sphere  with  any  conical  surface  of  the  second degree  whose  vertex  is  the  centre  of  the  sphere.
Properties  of  cones  of  the  second  degree  may  be  investi- gated by  sphero-conics,  and  are  analogous  to  the  properties of  conies.

CONFOCAL   QUADRICS.

are  confocal.    We  shall  assume  a>by  r.

X  still  diminishing,  a  series  of  one-fold  hyperboloids  appear until  X  = —li\  when  the  surface  coincides  with  the  focal hyperbola  on  the  zx  plane,
r^.  =   1.
.2         A2
b'      Ir-(r
The  surface  afterwards  developes  into  a  series  of  two-fold hyperboloids  until  \  =  —a\  when  it  becomes  an  imaginary focal  ellipse  on  tlie  yz  plane.
5658  Through  any  point  xyz  three  confocal  quadrics  can  be drawn  according  to  the  three  values  of  X  furnished  by  the second  equation  in  (5656).  That  equation,  cleared  of  frac- tions, becomes
5659  \^^{a'^b'+c'-.v''-jf-^')  \'
-\-a-b-c---b-r.i''—c-a^f/  —  a'b-z^  =  0.
These  three  confocals  are  respectively  an  ellipsoid,  a  one- fold hyperboloid,  and  a  two-fold  hyperboloid.  See  Figure (178);  P  is  the  point  xyz;  the  lines  of  intersection  of  the ellipsoid  with  the  two  hyperboloids  are  DFE  and  FPG,  and the  two  hyperboloids  themselves  intersect  in  HPK.
Proof.— Substitute  for  X  successively  in  (5659)  a',  b',  c\  — cc  ;  and  the left  member  of  the  equation  will  be  found  to  take  the  signs  + ,  — ,  + ,  — accordingly.  Consequently  there  are  real  roots  between  cr  and  l'-,  Ir  and  r, G'  and  —00  .
5660     Two  confocal  quadrics  of  different  species  cut  each other  everywhere  at  right  angles.
Proof. — Let  a,h,G;  a',  l/,  c  be  the  semi-axes  of  the  two  quadrics  ;  then, at  the  line  of  intersection  of  the  surfaces,  we  shall  have
772  SOLID  GEOMETRY.
"which,  since  a"'  —  d-  =■  I/' — h'  :=  c'  —  cr  =  X,  becomes  the  condition  of  per- pendicu^larity  of  the  normals  by  the  values  in  (5629).  Thus,  in  (Fig.  178), the  tangents  at  P  to  the  three  lines  of  intersection  of  the  surfaces  are mutually  at  right  angles.
5661  If  P  be  the  point  of  intersection  of  three  quadrics aJ)^Ci,  ajjx.,,  a.Jj.^c^  confocal  with  the  quaclric  abc ;  the  squares of  the  semi-axes,  rfg,  d^,  of  the  diametral  section  conjugate  to P  in  the  first  quadric  are  (considering  a^  >  a.2  >  a.^,  and  writing the  suffixes  in  circular  order)

obtain,  at  a  common  point  x'li'z,  — — '—    +  &c.  =  0.     Comparing  this  with
(5651),  the  quadratic  for  the  axes  of  the  section  of  the  quadric  by  the  plane lx-\-mij  +  nz  =■  0,  we  see  that,  if  Z,  m,  n  have  the  values  — ,  &c.,  /x  is  identical
with  ?-^;  the  plane  is  the  diametral  plane  of  P;  and  the  two  values  of  ^  are the  squares  of  its  axes.  Let  dl,  dl  be  these  values  ;  then,  since  there  are  but three  confocals,  the  two  values  of  /.<  must  give  the  remaining  confocals,  i.e., a^  —  d^  =  al  and  "j  — t?^  —  ^r
The  six  axes  of  the  sections  are  situated  as  shown  in  the diagram  (Fig.  179).  Either  axis  of  any  of  the  three  sections is  equal  to  one  of  the  axes  in  one  of  the  other  sections,  but the  equal  axes  are  not  those  which  coincide.  0  is  supposed to  be  the  centre  of  the  conicoids,  and  the  three  lines  are  drawn from  0  parallel  to  the  three  tangents  at  P  to  the  lines  of  in- tersection.

RECIPROCAL  AND  ENVELOPING  CONES.
5664  Def. — A  right  line  drawn  through  a  fixed  point  always perpendicular  to  the  tangent  plane  of  a  cone  generates  the reciprocal  cone.
The  enveloping  cone  of  a  quadric  is  the  locus  of  all tangents  to  the  surface  which  pass  through  a  fixed  point called  the  vertex.
5665  The  equations  of  a  cone  and  its  reciprocal  are  respec- tively
.Ar=+%=+6V  =  0   (i.),    and    i^  +  l  +  ^  =  0   (ii.).
Proof. — The  equations  of  the  tangent  plane  of  (i.)  at  any  point  xyz,  and of  the  perpendicular  to  it  from  the  origin,  are
Axl  +  Byn  +  Cz^  =  0   (iii.),    and     £  =  ^  =  J-   (iy.).

is,  liave  the  same  circular  section ;  and  the  reciprocals  of  con- cjclic  cones  are  confocal.
Proof. — A  series  of  concyclic  cones  is  given  by

the  common  vertex,  P,  of  the  cones,  are  given  by  the  equation
Proof. — Let  hnn  be  the  direction  of  the  perpendicular  jj  from  the  origin upon  the  tangent  plane  drawn  from  F  to  the  quadric.  Equate  the  ordinary value  of  j3^  at  (5G31)  with  that  found  by  projecting  OP  upon  p  ;  thus
(a-  +  X)  I-  +  (Z>-  -I-  X)  m-  +  (c-  +  X)  u'  =  (fl  +  gm  +  hn)-. "Now  p  generates  with  vertex  0  a  cone  similar  and  similarly  situated  to  the reciprocal  cone  with  vertex  P,  and  Z,  m,  n  are  proportional  to  .*■,  y,  z,  the coordinates  of  any  point  on  the  former  cone.     Therefore,  by  transferring  the origin  to  P,  the  equation  of  the  reciprocal  cone  is  as  stated.
5669  Cor.  —  These   reciprocal    cones    are    concyclic ;    and therefore  the  enveloping  cones  are  confocal  (5667).
5670  The  reciprocal  cones  in  (5668)  are  all  coaxal.
Proof. — Transform  the  cone  given  by  the  terms  in  (.5068)  without  X  to its  principal  axes  ;  and  its  equation  becomes  Ax-  +  Pij''+Cz-  =  0.  Now,  if the  whole  equation,  including  terms  in  X,  be  f-o  transformed,  .('■  +  ?/'■  +  , r  will not  be  altered.     Therefoi'e  we  shall  obtain
(A  +  \)x'+(n  +  X)if  +  (C  +  X);r  =  0, a  series  of  coaxal  cones.
5671  The  axes  of  the  enveloping  cone  are  the  three  normals to  the  three  confocals  passing  through  its  vertex.
Proof.— The  enveloping  cone  becomes  the  tangent  plane  at  P  for  a  con- focal through  P,  and  one  axis  in  this  case  is  the  normal  through  P.  Also tliis  axis  is  common  to  all  the  enveloping  cones  with  the  same  vertex,  by (5670).  But  there  are  three  confocals  through  P  (5658),  and  therefore three  normals  which  must  be  the  three  axes  of  the  enveloping  cone.
5672  The  equation  of  the  enveloping  cone  of  the  quadric
th:e!  general  quadbig.  775
-f^   \-  —^   \-  —   =  1   is,  when   transformed  to  its  prm-

where  X^,  \,,  Xg  are  the  values  of  X  for  the  three  confocals through  P,  the  vertex,  and  cli,  cl^  are  the  semi-axes  of  the diametral  section  of  P  in  the  first  confocal  (5661).
Proof. — Transform  equation  (5G68)  of  the  reciprocal  of  the  enveloping cone  to  its  principal  axes,  as  in  (5G70).  Let  Xj,  X.,,  \  be  the  values  o£  A which  make  the  quadric  become  in  turn  the  three  confocal  quadrics  through P.  Then  the  reciprocal  (A+X)  x'+(B  +  X)  if  +  {G  +  X)  z^  =  0  must  become a  right  line  in  each  case  because  the  enveloping  cone  becomes  a  plane. Therefore  one  coefficient  of  x'',  y^',  or  ,:'•'  must  vanish.  Hence  A  +  X^  =■  0, B i-X.^  =  0,   (7  +  X3  =  0.     Therefore  the  reciprocal  cone  becomes
(x-x,)  x'+(x-x.;)  ,f+(x-x,)  z'  =  0,
and  therefore  the  enveloping  cone  is
-^  +  -jI--+   ""'  =0.

THE  GENERAL  EQUATION  OF  A  QUADRIC.

ax'+by^+cz^-{-2fi/z-{-2gzaj-\-2Jhvi/-\-22hv-\-2qi/-]-2rz-\-d  =  0.
By  introducing  a  fourth  quasi  variable    ^  =  I,  the   equation may  be  put  in  the  homogeneous  form

as  in  (1620).
Transforming  to  an  origin  xyz  and  coordinate  axes parallel  to  the  original  ones,  by  substituting  x  -^^,  //  +  »?,  ^' -{-I for  X,  y,  and  z,  the  equation  becomes,  by  (1514),

5675  fie'+br+d'+2f7iC+2^ii+mv
where   U  =  f{x\  //',  z)   (omitting  the  accents).
5676  The  quadratic  for  r,  the  intercept  between  the  point xyz  and  the  quadric  surface  measured  on  a  right  line  drawn from  xy':/  in  the  direction  Imn,  is
r^  (al'--^b})r-\-  c}r-\-2fmn-\-2gnl-\-2hhn)
+  r  {UJ,-Jr-mUy-\-nU,)-^U  =  0.
Obtained  by  putting  ^  =  rl,   n  =  rm^  I  =  rn  in  (5674).
5677  The  tangents  from  any  external  point  to  a  quadric  are proportional  to  the  diameters  parallel  to  them.
Proof.— From  (5676),  as  in  (1215)  and  (4317).
5678  The  equation  of  the  tangent  plane  at  a  point  xijz  on the  quadric  is
(S-.V)  t/,,.+(r,-//)  u,Ml-~)  V.  =  0
5679  or  ^ll+r,U,  +  Ca+TU,  =  0,
with  T  and  t  made  equal  to  unity  after  differentiating.
Proof. — From  (5676).  Since  xyz  is  a  point  on  tbe  surface,  one  root  of the  quadratic  vanishes.  In  order  that  the  line  may  now  toucJi  the  surface, the  other  root  must  also  vanish;  therefore  lU^  +  mU  „  + 7ilL  ^=  0.  Put rl  =  ^  —  x,  rm  =  r]  —  i/,  rn  =  '(—z;  ^tji^  being  now  a  variable  point  on  the line,  and  therefore  on  the  tangent  plane.
5680  Again,  xU^  +  yU,  +  zU,  +  tU,  = -lU,    hy  (l&2^^), therefore  x  JJ^,  +  y  U,,  +  z  F.  = —tUf,
which  establishes  the  second  form  (5679).
5681  Equation  (5679)  also  represents  tlio  polar  plane  of any  point  xjjz  not  Ij^ing  on  the  quadric  surface.  Written  in full  it  l)ecomes

are  convertible,  U  standing  for  / (r,  ?/,  z)  in  the  first,  and  for /(^,  V,  t)  in  the  second.
5685  The  intersection  of  the  polar  planes  of  two  points  is called  the^oZar  line  of  the  points.
5686  The  polar  plane  of  the  vertex  is  the  plane  of  contact of  the  tangent  cone.
Proof. — If  ^ijii  be  the  vertex  and  xyz  the  point  of  contact,  equation (5683)  is  satisfied.  If  x,  y,  z  be  the  variables  and  l,ii'C  constant,  the  second form  of  that  equation  shows  that  the  points  of  contact  all  lie  on  the  polar plane  of  the  point  i,r]ii.
5687  Every  line  through  the  vertex  is  divided  harmonically by  the  quadric  and  the  polar  plane.
Proof. — In  equation  (5684)  put  x  =  i.  +  Bl,  y  =  r}-\-Bm,  s  =  i^+Bn  to determine  B,  the  distance  from  the  vertex  to  the  polar  plane.     This  gives

Now,  if  r,  r'  are  the  roots  of  the  quadratic  (5676),  with  |,  tj,  c,  written  for

5688  Every  line  {hnn)  drawn  through  a  point  xyz  parallel to  the  polar  plane  of  that  point  is  bisected  at  the  point,  and the  condition  of  bisection  is
Proof. — The  equation  is  the  condition  for  equal  roots  of  opposite  si^ns  in the  quadratic  (56/6).  Since  I,  m,  n  are  the  dir.  cos.  of  the  line  and  U^,  TJy, U^  those  of  the  normal  of  the  polar  plane  (5683),  the  equation  shows  that the  line  and  the  normal  are  at  right  angles  (5532).
5689  The  last,  when  x,  y,  z  are  the  variables,  is  also  the equation  of  the  diametral  plane  conjugate  to  the  direction  Imn. Expanded  it  becomes

Proof. — When  Imn,  in  (5689),  is  a  principal  diameter  of  the  quadric,  the diametral  plane  becomes  perpendicular  to  it,  and  therefore  the  coefficients  of X,  y,  z  must  be  proportional  to  I,  m,  n.  Putting  them  equal  to  El,  Em,  En respectively,  we  have  the  equations

therefore     (gh-af+Ef)  I  =  (hf-bg  +  Eg)  m  =  (fg-ch  +  Eh)  n,
which  establish  the  equations,  since   x  :  y  :  z  =  I  :  m  :  n  and  F  =  gh  —  af,

For  the  second  and  third  axes  write  /3  and  y  in  the  place  of  a.

Proof. — The  generating  line  through  xijz  moves  so  as  to  touch  the quadric.  Hence  the  quadratic  in  r  (5676)  must  have  equal  roots.  The  equa- tion admits  of  some  reduction.

RECIPROCAL   POLARS.
5704     The  method  of  reciprocal  polars  explained  at  page  665 is  equally  applicable  to  geometry  of  three  dimensions.
Taking  poles  and  polar  planes  with  respect  to  a  sphere  of reciprocation,  we  have  the  following  rules  analogous  to  those on  page  &QQ.
782
SOLID  GEOMETRY.
RULES  FOR  RECIPROCATING.
5705  ^  ijlane  becomes  a  jjoint.
5706  ^  plane  at  infinity  becomes  the  origin.
5707  Several  ijoints  on  a  straight  line  become  as  many  'planes passing  through  another  straight  line.  These  lines  are  called reciprocal  lines.
5708  Points  lying  on  a  plane  become  planes  passing  through a  pointy  the  pole  of  the  plane.
5709  Points  lying  on  a  surface  become  ptlanes  enveloping  the reciprocal  surface.
5710  Therefore,  by  rules  (5708)  and  (5709),  the  points  in the  intersection  of  the  plane  and  a  surface  become  planes passing  through  the  pole  of  the  jjlane  and  enveloped  both  by the  reciprocal  surface  and  by  its  tangent  cone.
5711  When  the  intersecting  plane  is  at  infinity,  the  vertex of  the  tangent  cone  is  the  origin.
5712  Therefore  the  asymptotic  cone  of  any  surface  is orthogonal  to  the  tangent  cone  drawn  from  the  origin  to  the reciprocal  surface.     The  cones  are  therefore  reciprocal.
5713  The  reciprocal  surface  of  the  guadric  is  a  hyperboloid, an  ellipsoid,  or  a  paraboloid,  according  as  the  origin  is  without, within,  or  upon  the  quadric  surface.
5714  The  angle  subtended  at  the  origin  by  ttoo points  is  equal to  the  angle  between  their  corresponding  planes.
5715  The  reciprocal  of  a  sphere  is  a  surface  of  revolution  of the  second  order.
5716  The  shortest  distance  betweeit  two  reciprocal  lines passes  through  the  origin.
5717  The  reciprocal  surface  of  the  general  quadric {abcdfghpqr\xy::\y  =  0  (5074),  the  auxiliary  sphere  being x^  +  y'^  +  z^  =  Jr,  is

THEOEY  OF  TORTUOUS  CUEVES.
5721  Definitions. — The  osculating  plane  at  any  point  of  a curve  of  double  curvature,  or  tortuous  ciirve,^  is  the  plane containing  either  two  consecutive  tangents  or  three  consecu- tive points.
5722  The  princiiml  normal  is  the  normal  in  the  osculating plane.  The  radius  of  circular  curvature  coincides  with  this normal  in  direction.
5723  The  binomial  is  the  normal  perpendicular  both  to  the tangent  and  principal  normal  at  the  point.
5724  The  osculating  circle  is  the  circle  of  curvature  in  the osculating  plane,  and  its  centre,  which  is  the  centre  of  circular curvature,  is  the  point  in  which  the  osculating  plane  intersects two  consecutive  normal  planes  of  the  curve.
5725  The  angle  of  contingence,  d^,  is  the  angle  between  two consecutive  tangents  or  principal  normals.  The  angle  of  torsion, cIt,  is  the  angle  between  two  consecutive  osculating  planes.
*  otherwise  named  "  space  curve."
784  SOLID  GEOMETRY.
5726  The  rcdifiiing  plane  at  any  point  on  the  curve  is  per- pendicular to  the  principal  normal ;  and  the  intersection  of two  consecutive  rectifying  planes  is  the  rectifying  line  and axis  of  the  osculating  cone.
5727  The  osculating  cone  is  a  circular  cone  touching  three consecutive  osculating  planes  and  having  its  vertex  at  their point  of  intersection.
The  rectifying  developable  is  the  envelope  of  the  rectifying planes,  and  is  so  named  because  the  curve,  being  a  geodesic on  this  surface,  would  become  a  straight  line  if  the  surface were  developed  into  a  plane.
'&■
5728  The  polar  developable  is  the  envelope  of  the  normal planes,  being  the  locus  of  the  line  of  intersection  of  two  con- secutive normal  planes.  Three  consecutive  normal  jjlanes intersect  in  a  point  which  is  the  centre  of  spherical  curvature  : for  a  sphere  having  that  centre  may  be  described  passing- through  four  consecutive  points  of  the  curve.
5729  The  edge  of  regression  is  the  locus  of  the  centre  of spherical  curvature.
5730  The  rectifying  surface  is  the  surface  of  centres  (5773) of  the  polar  developable.
5731  An  evolute  of  a  curve  is  a  geodesic  line  on  the  polar developable.  It  is  the  line  in  which  a  free  string  would  lie  if stretched  between  two  points,  one  on  the  curve  and  one  any- where on  the  smooth  surface  of  the  polar  developable.
5732  In  Figure  (180)  A,  A',  A",  A'"  are  consecutive  points  on  a  curve. The  normal  planes  drawn  through  A  and  A'  intersect  in  GE  ;  those  thruugli A'  and  A"  in  G'E',  and  those  through  A"  and  A'"  in  G"E".  GE  meets  G'E' in  E,  and  G'E'  meets  G"E"  iu  E'.  The  principal  normals  in  tlie  normal planes  are  AG,  A'G',  A"G",  and  these  are  also  the  radii  of  curvature  at A,  A',  A",  while  G,  G',  G"  are  the  centres  of  curvature.  Z.  AG  A'  =  dij/  and CA'G'  =dT.
The  surface  EGG'G"E'  is  the  polar  developable,  GG'G"  being  the  locus of  the  centres  of  curvature,  and  EE'E"  is  the  edge  of  regression.
EA  is  tiie  radius  and  E  the  centre  of  spherical  curvatui-e  for  the  point A.  hll,  nil',  WW  are  elemental  choi-ds  of  an  evolute  of  the  curve,  AhS being  a  normal  at  A,  and  A'lIW  a  normal  at  A' ,  and  so  on.  The  first normal  drawn  is  arbitrary,  but  it  determines  the  position  of  all  the  rest.

At  any  other  point  E"  of the  evolute,  where  its  tangent  is  A"E'E",  let  the  corresponding  angle  be 0  =  G"A"S".  Then  0  =  a  — r,  r  being  the  sum  of  the  angles  of  torsion between  A  and  A",  or  the  total  amount  of  twist  of  the  osculating  plane.  Now the  normal  of  the  osculating  plane  of  the  evolute  at  E",is  perpendicular  to EE'  and  E'E",  two  consecutive  tangents.  Therefore  its  dir.  cosines  in (5744)  must  be

THEORY  OF  SURFACES.  791
5772  A  normal  plane  is  any  plane  through  the  normal.
5773  A  line  of  curvature  on  a  surface  is  a  line  along  which consecutive  normals  to  the  surface  intersect.  At  every  point of  a  surface  there  are  usually  two  lines  of  curvature  at  right angles  to  each  other ;  and  to  these  correspond  two  principal radii  of  curvature.  The  two  lines  of  curvature  coincide  with the  principal  axes  of  the  indicatrix  at  the  point.     See  (5778).
5774  The  surface  of  centres  is  the  locus  of  the  centres of  principal  curvature.  There  are  two  such  surfaces,  for there  are  two  centres  on  each  normal,  and  the  normal  is  a tangent  to  both  surfaces.  Either  surface  may  be  regarded  as generated  by  the  evolutes  of  the  lines  of  principal  curvature.
5775  A  geodesic  is  a  line  traced  on  a  surface  along  which the  osculating  plane  at  every  point  contains  the  normal  to the  surface.     See  (5779).
5776  The  radius  of  geodesic  curvature  *  of  a  curve  traced on  a  surface  is  measured  by  the  ratio  of  the  element  of  arc  of the  curve  to  the  angle  between  consecutive  normal  sections of  the  surface  drawn  through  consecutive  tangents  of  the curve.  Geodesic  curvature,  being  the  reciprocal  of  this,  is therefore  the  rate  of  angular  deviation  of  the  normal  section per  unit  length  of  the  curve.
5777  An  umhiUcus  is  a  point  on  a  surface  where  a  section parallel  to  and  close  to  the  tangent  plane  is  a  circle ;  in  other words,  the  indicatrix  is  a  circle.
For  a  definition  of  Indicatrix,  see  (5795).

The  normals  to  the  line  of curvature  BOB'  at  B  and  0,  drawn  in  the  osculating  plane  BOB',  intersect  in K,  and  those  at  B'  and  0  intersect  in  H.  HOD  is  the  angle  between  the osculating  plane  of  the  line  of  curvature  and  the  plane  of  normal  section. Similarly  for  the  line  of  curvature  AOA'.
5779  If  POP'  be  a  geodesic,  its  osculating  plane  POP'  contains  OD  the normal  to  the  surface  at  0,  and  therefore  p  =  OD,  the  radius  of  curvature of  this  section  at  0  ;  but  PE,  the  normal  to  the  surface  at  P,  does  not  inter- sect OD,  the  consecutive  normal  at  0,  unless  the  geodesic  coincides  with  one of  the  lines  of  curvatui-e,  OA  or  OB.  The  angle  DPE  is  the  angle  of  torsion which  vanishes  in  the  latter  case.

B  is  an  indefinitely  small  radius  from  the  centre  of the  quadric  (I.)  to  a  point  ivt  on  the  indicatrix,  and  p  is  the radius  of  curvature  of  the  section  of  the  surface  </>  by  a  normal plane  drawn  through  B ;  the  ratio  B'^  :  p  being  constant  for all  such  planes.
Proof.— Let  0,  in  Fi^.  (181),  be  the  point  xyz  on  the  surface  (p;  x  +  E, 2/ +  r/,  2  + C  an  adjacent  point  P.     Then
<p(x  +  ^,y  +  V,  z  +  0=(p(x,  y,  z)  +  ^^  +  m»;  +  «^+i(a^H...+2//^^»^)+&c. With  xyz  for  origin,  draw  the  quadric  surface
ae  +  hrf^ce+2frj-C^2ga  +  2Ur^  =  N   (i.)
and  the  plane  ll+m^i  +  nli^^N  =  0   (ii.)-
Since  I,  V,  <r  are  very  small,  N  is  likewise.  Also  the  unwritten  terms  in  the above  expansion  may  be  neglected  in  the  limit.  Hence,  any  point  ^?y4  lying on  the  intersection  of  the  quadric  (i.)  and  the  plane  (ii.)  will  also  lie  on  the original  surface   f  (x  +  t„  y  +  ii,  ^  +  0  =  ^•
To  determine  N,  we  have  the  perpendicular  from  a-y,?  upon  the  plane  (ii.),

^       2  ^(P  +  m'  +  n')
surface  0  made  by  a  normal  plane  at  0  drawn  through  P  being  p,  we  have
P  =  —,  and  therefore  N  =  -  —  ^Q'  +  m'  +  n'). 2p  p
In  the  Figure,  B  =  OP,  p  =  OL,  and  the  intersection  of  (i.)  and  (ii.)  is the  conic  PSQ.  Since  p  is  indefinitely  small,  we  may  put  N=0  in  equa- tion (ii.).  This  amounts  to  taking  the  parallel  section  of  the  quadric  by  the tangent  plane  at  0  instead  of  the  section  PSQ.  But  these  two  will  be  equal in  all  respects,  since  the  section  of  the  quadric  is  a  central  one.
5800  If  m  =  0,  equation  (II.)  becomes   l^-^nl  =  0,   and  if the  inchnation  of  the  indicatrix  plane  to  the  plane  of  xy  be  a,
tan  a  =  —  — .     To  obtain,   in  this  case,  the  equation  of  the
n indicatrix  in  its  own  plane,  put   ^  =  ^'  cos  a,   1  =  t  sin  a,   and 7,  =  77',  in  equation  (I.).
5801  When  none  of  the  three   constants   /,  m,  n  are  zero, the  quadric  (I.)  simplifies  as  follows —
From  (II.)  we  have  /^+m»}  =  —nl  and  two  similar  equa- tions. Square  these,  and  by  the  results  ehminate  the  terms in  nl,  II,  h]  from  (I.),  which  then  becomes

This  is  the  equation  of  another  quadric  intersecting  the plane  (II.)  in  the  indicatrix.
5803     The  equation  of  a  surface  for  points  near  an  origin  0 (Fig.  182),  the  normal  at  0  being  taken  for  z  axis,  is

where  pi,  p.,  are  the  radii  of  curvature  of  the  normal  sections through  the  x  and  y  axes,  and  those  sections  will  be  proved  to be  the  lines  of  curvature  at  0.
Proof. — Let  AG=i  a  and  BG  =  1  he.  the  semi-axes  of  the  indicatrix  conic at  a  small  distance  z  from  0  (5795).     The  equation  of  the  conic  will  there-

Secondly,  on  a  line  of  curvature,  the  normal  to  the  surface  at  a  point  xyz will  intersect  the  z  axis  (5773).  The  condition  for  this,  by  (5533)  [with xyz  for  abc,  the  origin  for  a'h'c,

Proof. — From  equation  (I.)  (5798),  since  ^,  ri,  i  are  respectively  equal to  R\,  Rfi,  and  Rv.
5818  The  curvature  at  any  point  of  a  surface  (p{x,  y,z)  =  0 is  termed  ellvptic  or  synclastic,  liyperholic  or  anticlasfic,  and paraholic  or  cylindrical,  according  as  the  indicatrix  is  an elhpse,  hyperbola,  or  two  parallel  right  lines,  or  according  as the  principal  curvatures  have  the  same  signs,  opposite  signs, or  one  of  them  vanishes ;  and  this  will  be  according  as  the determinant  A',  in  (5814),  or  s^—rt,  in  (5816),  is  negative, positive,  or  zero.
Proof. — The  i-ule  follows  at  once  from  the  consideration  that  the  two values  of  p  in  the  quadratic  of  (5814)  must  have  the  same  sign  in  the  first case,  different  signs  in  the  second,  and  that  one  value  must  be  infinite  in  the third  case.
5819  The  condition  for  an  umbilicus  is  that  the  indicatrix must  be  a  circle ;  therefore,  either  (III.)  (5802)  must  be  a sphere,  or,  if  it  be  a  quadric  surface,  the  plane  (II.)  must make  a  circular  section  of  it,  and  therefore  either  /,  m,  or  n must  vanish.
5820  Otherwise,  the  quadratic  in  (5814)  or  (5816)  must have  equal  roots.

Proof. — The  radius  of  the  indicatrix,  and  therefore  also  p  in  (5817),  is constant  for  all  values  of  X,  ju,  v.     Now,  by  (5817),

and  l\  +  iufx  +  ni'  =  0,  since  X/^v  is  always  tangential,  and  Inm  is  normal  to the  surface.  As  these  equations  are  true  for  all  values  of  X,  n,  v,  the  second expression  must  be  a  factor  of  the  first.     The  quotient,  by  division,  is  there-

Equating  to  zero  each  of  the  three  coefficients  of  the  remainder,  and  elimi- nating p,  we  obtain  the  above  conditions.
5822  If  a  common  factor  of  the  three  fractions  m  (5821) exists,  that  factor  equated  to  zero  is  the  differential  equation of  a  line  of  spherical  curvature  at  every  point  of  which  there is  an  umbihcus.  If  the  fractions  are  identically  equal,  the surface  has  an  umbilicus  at  every  point,  and  must  therefore be  a  sphere.

5824  The  condition  that  the  indicatrix  may  be  a  rectangular hyperbola  is
{a-\-b+c){l^-\-7ri'-\-n')  =  {ahcfgh\lmnY.
Proof. — The  quadratic  in  (5814)  must  have  equal  roots  of  opposite signs.
Similarly,  when  z  =  (p  (x,  y)  is  the  equation  of  the  quadric,  the  condition becomes  0-+P^)  t-2pqs+(l  +  q^)  r  =0.  (5816)

Here  equation  I.  (5798)  must  represent  a  cone,  and  the  plane  (TI.) must  touch  it.  Hence  N  =  0,  and,  if  ^  be  eliminated,  the  quadratic  for  the ratio  ^  :  ?/  obtained  is

CURVATURE  OF  A  SURFACE.
5826  Defs. — Integral  curvature  of  a  closed  surface  is  equal to  the  area  of  that  part  of  the  surface  of  a  sphere  of  unit radius  which  is  intercepted  by  radii  drawn  parallel  to  the
THEORY  OF  SURFACES.  801
normals  at  all  points  of  the  given  surface.  This  area  also measures  the  solid  angle  of  the  cone  generated  by  the  radii. The  curve  on  the  sphere  is  called  the  liorogrcqjli  of  the  curve on  the  original  surface.  In  other  words,  integral  curvature of  a  closed  surface  is  the  area  of  the  horograph  of  its boundary.
5827  Average  curvature  is  the  integral  curvature  divided  by the  area  of  the  surface.

according  as  .^  (.v,  i/," ^)  =  0  or  z  =  <^  {e,  y)  is  the  form  of  the equation  to  the  surface.
Proof.— From  the  product  of  roots  of  the  quadratics  in  (5814)  and (5816).
5829  In  a  plane  curve  integral  curvature  is  the  plane  angle contained  by  the  terminal  normals,  and  average  curvature  is the  integral  curvature  divided  by  the  length  of  the  curve.
5830  Another  measure  of  curvature  at  a  given  point  of  a surface  is  the  ratio  of  the  area  of  the  indicatrix  to  the  area  of the  indicatrix  cut  off  by  the  same  plane  on  a  sphere  of  unit radius  .which  touches  the  surface  internally  at  the  point.  This measure  is  =  \/piP2-
Proof.— Putting  AC  =  R„  BC  =  R,,  in  Fig.  (182),  and  OC  =  z,  the  area of  the  indicatrix  of  the  surface  is  ■kR^U,^  at  an  elhpsoidal  point.  But B\  -  2p^s  and  Rl  =  2p,z,  therefore  ttR.R,  =  27rz  /(piP.,).  Also  the  indicatrix of  the  sphere  =  27rz  s'ince  Pi  =  p.  =  1  for  the  sphere.
5831  The  radius  of  curvature  of  any  normal  section  at  a point  P  of  an  elhpsoid  (Fig.  184)  is  equal  to  the  square  of the   semi-diameter  parallel   to  the   tangent  of   that  section,
5   K
802  SOLID  GEOMETRY.
divided  by  the  perpendicular  from  P  upon  the  diametral plane  conjugate  to  OP.
Proof. —  Let  AOB  be  the  plane  parallel  to  the  tangent  plane  at  P; OA  =  d,  the  semi-diameter  in  it  parallel  to  the  given  tangent  PT.  Draw PB  perpendicular  to  OA  and  PN^p  perpendicular  to  the  plane  AOB.    The
radius  of  curvature  at  P  of  the  elliptic  section  PA  =  ~-  (4536).    Therefore,
by  (5809),  the  radius  of  curvature  of  the  normal  section  through  the  same
tangent  PT,  will  ^e  P  =  ^  X  ||  =  ^.
5832  The  principal  radii  of  curvature  at  P,  viz.  p^,  p.2,  are found  from  their  sum  and  product  thus  :  putting  y  for  OP, and  a,  h,  c  for  the  semi-axes  of  the  ellipsoid,
P,+P.=  -^—^   ^-,     p^p,  =  —r-.

5833     The  lines  of  curvature  on  a  quadric  surface  are  its intersections  with  the  confocal  quadrics.
Proof.  —  Let  the  quadric  and  confocal  be  the  ellipsoid  and  one-fold hyperboloid  in  (Fig.  178)  intersecting  in  the  line  DPE,  and  let  their  equa- tions be,  as  in  (5656),

(b'-c')xdi/dz+{c''-a')ijchcU  +  (a'-b')zdxdy  =  0    (i.).
To  solve  this,  multiply  by  -^  and  substitute  for  z  and  dz  from  the  equation
of  tbe  quadric.     The  result  is  of  the  form
Axyyl+(x--Ajf-B)  y^-xy  =  0,
in  which  A  =  t^%  B  =  ^1^^^  ;   or,  multiplying  by  ^, ¥{a-  —  c-)  ci'  —  c-  X
A'^  {xyy^-y-)-B'&  +{xyy^-f)  =  0,
X  X
which  is  of  the  form  in  (3236).  Solving  by  that  method,  we  find  that  the two    equations    ^  =  a     and    xyy^—y^  =  /3    have   the   common     pinmitive
X
ax^—y^  =  fi,  which,  with  the  relation  Aa^-Ba-^fi  =  0,  constitutes  the solution.  The  result  is  that  the  projections  of  the  lines  of  curvature  upon the  xy  plane  are  a  series  of  conies  coaxal  with  the  principal  section  of  the ellipsoid,  and  having  their  axes  a,  6  varying  according  to  the  equation
At  an  umbilicus  ^^  =  0,  therefore,  equation  (i.)  becomes  \_{h- —  c^)  xdz +  (a^  — 6')  zdx']  dy  =  0.  Here  dy  =  0,  being  a  solution,  gives  y  =  G  =  0, showing  that  the  plane  of  zx  contains  a  line  of  cnrvature.  The  other factor,  equated  to  zero,  taken  with  the  differential  equation  of  the  curve cKxdx  +  a^zdz  =  0,  gives  the  coordinates  of  the  umbilicus,  as  in  (5603).
OSCULATING  PLANE  OF  A  LINE  OF  CURVATURE.
5835  Let  (f>  be  the  angle  between  the  osculating  plane  and the  normal  section  through  the  same  line  of  curvature,  ds^  an element  of  the  other  line  of  curvature,  and  p,  p  their  radii  of curvature  respectively  :  then
as     p  —p
Pkoof.— Fig.  (185).  Let  OA,  OB  be  the  lines  of  curvature;  OP,  AP consecutive  normals  along  OA ;  and  OS,  BS  the  same  along  OB.  Also,  let BQ,  CQ  be  consecutive  normals  along  the  line  of  curvature  BG.  Then, ultimately,  OP  =  p,  OS  =  p',  BQ  =  p  +  dp.  Also,  let  QP  produced  meet  the osculating  plane  of  ^0  in  R.  Join  BO  and  RA,  and  draw  QN  at  right  angles to  PS.  Since  the  tangent  to  ^0  at  0  is  perpendicular  to  the  plane  0B(2P and  that  at  A  to  AG(2P,  it  follows  that  both  tangents  are  perpendicular  to QP,  which  must  therefore  be  perpendicular  to  the  osculating  plane  ARO. Hence  (j>  or  ROP  =  PQN.

Proof. — The  osculating  plane  of  the  curve  contains  the  normal  to  the surface  (5775)  ;   therefore,  by  (5737)  and  (5785).
5838  A  geodesic  is  a  line  of  maximum  or  minimum  distance along  the  surface  between  two  points.
Proof. — The  curve  drawn  in  the  osculating  plane  from  one  point  to  a contiguous  point  is  shorter  than  any  other  by  Meunier's  theorem  (5809), for  any  oblique  section  has  a  shorter  radius  of  curvature  and  therefore  a longer  arc.  A  succession  of  minimum  arcs,  however,  may  constitute  a  maxi- mum curve  distance  between  the  extreme  points  ;  for  example,  two  points  on a  sphere  can  be  joined  by  either  of  two  arcs  of  a  great  circle,  the  one  being a  minimum  and  the  other  a  maximum  geodesic.
5839  A  surface  of  revolution  such  as  the  terrestrial  globe  affords  a  good illustration.  A  meridian  and  a  parallel  of  latitude  drawn  through  a  point near  the  pole  are  the  two  lines  of  curvature  at  the  point.  The  meridian  is also  a  geodesic,  but  the  parallel  is  evidently  not,  for  its  plane  does  not contain  the  normal  to  the  surface.
5840  A  geodesic  is  the  line  in  which  a  string  would  lie  if stretched  over  the  convex  side  of  a  smootli  surface  between two  fixed  points.
Proof. — Any  small  arc  of  the  string  POP'  (Fig.  182)  is  acted  upon  by tensions  along  the  tangents  at  P  and  P',  and  by  the  normal  reaction  of  the surface  at  0.  But  these  three  forces  act  in  the  osculating  plane  (5775)  ; therefore  the  string  will  rest  in  equilibrium  on  the  surface  in  that  plane.
THEORY  OF  SUEFACES.  805
CoE. — Two  equal  geodesies  drawn  from  a  point  and  in- definitely near  to  each  other  are  at  right  angles  to  the  line which  joins  their  extremities.
5841  If  a  geodesic  has  a  constant  inclination  to  a  fixed  line, the  normals  along  it  will  be  at  right  angles  to  that  line.
Proof. — Let  Imn  be  the  fixed  line  and  a  the  constant  angle ;  then Ixg  +  mj/g  +  nzg  =  cos  a,     and  therefore     lx2s  +  my2s  +  nzos  =■  0. Therefore,  by  (5837),  the  principal  normal  is  at  right  angles  to  Imn. Example. — The  helix,  the  axis  being  the  fixed  line.
5842  On  any  central  conicoid  2^d  is  constant  along  a  geo- desic, where  p  is  the  perpendicular  from  the  centre  upon  the tangent  plane  and  d  is  the  semi-diameter  parallel  to  the tangent  of  the  geodesic.
Proof. — (Fig.  186.)  Let  AT,  BT  be  the  tangents  at  the  two  extremities of  a  small  geodesic  arc  AB,  and  let  the  tangent  planes  at  A  and  B  be  ABC and  BOB.  AT  and  BT  make  equal  angles  with  GB,  by  the  property  of shortest  distance,  for  if  the  plane  BOB  be  turned  about  GB  until  it  coincides with  the  plane  ABG,  ATB  will  become  a  straight  line,  and  therefore /.ATB  =  BTG  =  i,  say.
Let  w  be  the  angle  between  the  tangent  planes ;  let  the  perpendiculars upon  those  planes  from  A,  B  be  AM  ~  q,  BN=  q,  and  from  the  centre  of  the quadric  p,  p  ;  and  let  xyz  and  x'y'z'  be  the  points  A,  B.     Then
q  =  ATsmiBinu),     q' =  BT  sin  i  sin  u),      :.  q  :  q   —  AT  :  BT    (i.),
therefore  q  '.  q  =  p'  '•  p    (ii-)-
Again,  let  d,  d'  be  the  semi-diametei^s  pai-allel  to  AT  and  BT.  Then,  by (5677),  AT  :  BT  =  d  :  d' ;  therefore  p'  :  p  =  d  :  d'  or  pd=p'd' ;  that  is, pd  is  constant.
5843  If  a  line  of  curvature  be  plane,  that  plane  makes  a constant  angle  with  the  tangent  plane  to  the  surface.
Proof. — Let  PQ,  QB,  BS  be  equal  consecutive  elements  of  the  line  of curvature.  The  consecutive  normals  to  the  surface  bisect  PQ  and  QB  and meet  in  a  point.  Therefore  they  are  equally  inclined  to  the  plane  PQB. Similarly  the  second  and  third  normals  are  equally  inclined  to  the  plane  QBS, and  so  on.  Hence,  if  the  curve  be  plane,  all  the  normals  are  equally  inclined to  its  plane.     Hence  also  the  following  theorem.

806  SOLID  GEOMETRY.
curvature  is  equal  to  the  angle  between  consecutive  osculating planes.
5845  CoE. — -If  a  geodesic  be  either  a  line  of  curvature  or  a plane  curve,  it  is  both,  but  a  plane  line  of  curvature,  as  in (5839),  is  not  necessarily  a  geodesic.
GEODESIC    CURVATURE.
Theorem. — The  square  of  the  curvature  at  any  point  of  a curve  traced  on  a  surface  is  equal  to  the  sum  of  the  squares of  the  normal  and  geodesic  curvatures  (5776),  or
5846  7  =  ?5  +  P^'
where  p  is  the  radius  of  curvature  of  the  normal  section  and p"  the  radius  of  geodesic  curvature.  Also,  if  <^  be  the  angle between  the  plane  of  normal  section  and  the  osculating  plane,
5847  p  —  p"  sin  ^  =  p  cos  <^-
Proof.— Let  FQ  =  QU  (Fig.  187)  be  consecutive  elements  of  any  curve traced  on  a  surface.  Prodace  FQ  to  ,S',  making  Q8  =  FQ.  Let  QT  =  FQ be  the  consecutive  elements  of  the  section  of  the  surface  drawn  through FQS  and  the  normal  at  Q.  Join  ES,  ST,  TE.  FQSB  is  the  osculating plane  of  the  curve  FQE.  FQST  is  the  plane  of  normal  section,  and  there- fore FQT  is  a  geodesic.  QET  is  the  tangent  plane,  and  STE  is  a  right angle.
Then,  putting  *SQ7i;  =  #,  SQT=d^',  EQT=d^l^",  EST  =  cp,  we  have ds         /        ds         „         ds  ,f,.._,.

Thus  both  theorems  are  proved.  Note  that  p'  is  the  radius  of  curvature  of the  geodesic  FQT,  while  p"  is  the  radius  of  geodesic  curvature  of  FQE.

Proof.— (Fig.  182.)  Let  OP  =  ds  be  the  geodesic,  OA,  OB  the  lines  of curvature,  and  0  ~  AGP.  The  angle  of  torsion  ch  measures  the  rotation  of the  normal  to  the  surface  round  OP  =  ds.  But  this  angle  is  equal  to  the sum  of  the  rotations  of  the  normal  round  OA  and  OB  resolved  along  ds. For,  in  travelling  along  each  of  the  lines  GN  and  NP,  which  are  iu  the  direc- tions of  the  lines  of  curvature,  the  normal  rotates  only  about  the  other. Therefore,  if  Wj,  Wj  be  the  rotations  round  OA,  OB,   dr  =  w^  cos  9  + Wj  sin  0.

5849  The  product  _2^fZ  lias  tlie  same  value  for  all  geodesies which  touch  the  same  line  of  curvature.
Proof. — By  theorems  (5836)  and  (5842),  since  the  product  where  they touch  it  must  be  the  same  as  that  for  the  line  of  curvature.
5850  The  product  j)d  has  the  same  value  for  all  geodesies drawn  through  any  umbilicus  on  a  conicoid.
Proof. — The  semi-diameter  d,  in  this  case,  is  the  radius  of  a  circular section,  and  therefore  equal  to  the  mean  semi-axis  h  for  all  the  geodesies ; andp  is  the  same  for  all.
5851  The  geodesies  drawn  through  any  point  on  a  conicoid to  two  umbilici  make  equal  angles  with  either  line  of  curva- ture through  the  point.
Proof. —  ipd  is  the  same  for  each  geodesic,  by  the  last,  and  p  is  the  same for  each  ;  thei'efore  d  is  the  same,  that  is,  the  diameters  parallel  to  the  two geodesies  at  the  point  ai-e  equal ;  therefore  they  are  equally  inclined  to  each axis  of  their  section  ;  but  these  axes  are  parallel  to  the  lines  of  curvature (5803)  ;  therefore,  &c.
5852  Hence  the  geodesies  joining  any  point  to  two  opposite umbilici  lying  on  the  same  diameter  are  continuations  of  each other.
5853  The  sum  of  the  distances  of  any  point  on  a  line  of curvature  from  two  interior  umbilici  is  constant ;  and  the difference  of  the  distances  from  one  interior  and  one  exterior umbilicus  is  constant.
Proof. — Geometrically,  as  in  the  analogous  theorem  for  the  focal  distances in  a  conic,  if  r,  r' are  the  distances  and  r-\-dr,  r' ■\-dr'  the  distances  for  a consecutive  point  on  the  line  of  curvature,  it  follows  from  (5851)  that dr  =■  —dr    for  interior  umbilici  and  dr  =  dr'  for  exterior  ones.
5854  A  system  of  lines  of  curvature  and  the  umbilici  on  a

quadric  surface  has  therefore  analogous  properties  with  a system  of  cod  focal  conies  and  their  foci  in  a  plane,  the  geo- desies corresponding  to  straight  lines.
5855  111  tlie  same  way,  every  surface  has  a  geodesic  geo- metry proper  to  itself ;  spherical  trigonometry,  for  instance, being  the  geodesic  geometry  of  the  sphere.
INVAEIANTS.
INVARIANTS  OF  A  SINGLE  FUNCTION.
5856  The  constancy  of  the  ratio  B^  :  p  in  equation  (5798) gives  rise  to  the  following  invariant  forms.  Since  the  quadric surface  I  and  the  tangent  plane  II  are  the  same  for  all  posi- tions of  the  coordinate  axes,  they  have  been  called  respec- tively the  invariable  quadric  and  the  invariable  ]jlane.  As  a consequence,
5857  <lyr-^4>l+i^
is  an  invariant  of   (j)  {x,  ij,  z) .
Proof. — By  (5791),  since  iho  perpendicnlar  from  the  origin  upou  tlie invariable  plane  is  constant.  Also,  the  coefficients  of  the  discriminating cubic  (5693)  of  the  invariable  quadric  will  not  be  altered  by  transformation of  axes.     Therefore  the  following  are  also  invariant  forms  : —

5861  A  similar  theorem  applied  to  a  function  (p  (x,  ?/)  of two  variables  gives  the  invariable  conic  and  invariable  line; namely,
r<^,,+2£7;<^,,+f<^,,  =  l     and     i<l>,,-^yj<l>,  =  1 ;
and  from  these  the  invariants,

Proof.  —  Form   the  cosine   of  the   angle    between   the   invariable  lines ^^x  +  Vfi/=  1  and  t,4'j;-\- r,\}/^  =  1,  observing  (5863).
Also  tlie  two  following  expressions  are  invariants,
5869  4,,,xj,,,,+^,,,f,,-2,l>...„xl..,„,
5870  .^,../.,„.+<^„^,,+2f,,.|.„,.
Proof. — From  the  invariable  conies  (5861)  of  ^  and  ij/,  we  get
invariable  for  any  value  of  X.     Hence  the  coefficients  of  the  several  powers of  X  in  the  invariant
(02. + Af ,.)  i<p,, + H;,)  -  if., + H.,y
are  also  invariants.     This   gives  (5869).     Subtracting  the  latter  from  the invariant  i<p2x  +  f2!,)(4'2x  +  ^2i/)  produces  (5870).

QUADRATURE  AND  CUBATURE.  811
Guldin's  Rules. — When  the  generating  curve  of  a  surface of  revolution  is  a  closed  curve,  and  does  not  cut  the  axis  of revolution,  a  solid  annulus,  or  ring,  is  formed.
5879  I^ULE  I. — The  volume  of  the  solid  ring  is  equal  to  the area  of  the  generating  curve  multiplied  hij  the  circumference  of the  circle  described  by  the  centroid*  of  the  area.
5880  Rule  II.  —  The  surface  of  the  ring  is  equal  to  the perimeter  of  the  generating  curve  multiplied  by  the  circum- ference described  by  the  centroid  of  the  perimeter.
Proof. — Let  A  be  the  area  of  the  closed  curve,  and  dA  any  element  of  A at  a  distance  y  from  the  axis  of  revolution.     The  volume  generated
=z\2TrydA  =  2TT\ydA  =  2nyA,
by  the  definition  of  the  centroid  (5885),  y  being  its  distance  from  the  axis. Similarly,  if  P  be  the  perimeter,  writing  P  instead  of  A.

Proof. — The  element  of  area  between  two  consecutive  curves  (y)  and (y +  (Zy)  projected  on  the  xy  plane  will  be  dF  {y)  =  F' {y)  dy ;  and,  since  the slope  is  the  same  throughout  the  curve  (y),  this  projected  element  must  be equal  to  the  corresponding  element  of  the  surface  multiplied  by  cos  y.
5882  Rule.  —  Equate  coefficients  of  the  equation  of  the tangent  p)lane  ivith  those  of  fe  +  mrj  +  nZ;  =  p,  and  eliminate  I and  mfrom  P-f  m^+n^  =  1.  The  result  will  be  an  equation  in X,  y  and  n  =  cos  7,  representing  the  projection  of  the  curve  (7) upon  the  xy  plane.     From  this  F  (7)  must  be  found.
5883  Ex.— Taking  the  elliptic  paraboloid  ^  +  ^  =  2z ;  the  tangent plane  at  rc^/z  is  ^  +  ^  —  ^  = -•  Equating  coefScients  of  the  last  with l^  +  mrj  +  nl^  =p,  and  substituting  for  I  and  m  in  V  +  m^  +  n'^  =  1,  we  obtain for  the  projection  on  the  xy  plane,  ^  +  j^  =  tan^y.

CENTRE  OF  MASS.
5884  Definitions. — The  moment  of  a  body  witli  respect  to  a plane  is  the  sum  of  the  products  of  each  element  of  mass  of the  body  and  the  distance  of  the  element  from  the  plane.
5885  The  distance  (denoted  by  x)  of  the  centre  of  mass  * from  the  same  plane  is  equal  to  the  moment  of  the  body divided  by  its  mass.
5886  WoTE. — If  the  body  be  of  nniform  density,  as  is  supposed  to  be  the case  in  all  the  following  examples,  assume  unity  for  the  density,  and  read volume  instead  of  mass  in  the  above  definitions.
The  definition  gives  the  following  formulas  for  the  position of  the  centre  of  mass  of  a  uniform  body  :

For  y,  change  x  into  y  and  cos  d  into  sin  d ;  but  observe  that  in  all  cases, if  the  body  be  symmetrical  about  the  axis  of  x,  [/  vanishes.  The  formula gives  the  centre  of  volume  of  the  portion  of  the  curve  included  between  the limits  of  integration.

The  second  forms  for  x  and  y  give  the  centroid  of  an  area  like  SPP' (Fig.  28).  The  double  integrals  applied  to  that  figure  require  the  limits  of the  integration  for  r  to  be  from  0  to  F{d),  aiicl  afterwards  for  0,  from 01  =  ASP  to  02  =  ASP'.  But,  if  applied  to  the  area  in  (Fig.  109),  the  order of  integration  must  be  reversed,  as  explained  in  (6209).

5920  Theorem- 1. — The  M.  I.  of  a  lamina  about  an  axis  per- pendicular to  its  plane  is  equal  to  the  sum  of  the  two  M.  I. about  any  two  axes  in  its  plane  drawn  through  the  foot  of  the perpendicular  axis  and  at  right  angles  to  each  other.
Proof. — By  the  definition  (5903),  and  Euc.  i.  47.
5921  Theorem  11. — The  M.  I.  of  a  body  about  a  given  axis, plane,  or  point  is  equal  to  the  M.  I.  about  a  parallel  axis  or plane  through  the  centroid,  or  about  the  centroid  itself respectively,  plus  the  M.  I.  of  the  whole  mass,  supposed  col- lected at  the  centroid,  about  the  given  axis,  plane,  or  point.
Proof. — In  the  figure,  p.  168,  let  the  given  axis  be  perpendicular  to  the paper  at  B;  let  J.  be  the  centroid,  and  m  an  element  of  mass  at  G ;  then,  for every  thin  section  of  the  solid  parallel  to  the  paper,

JL,  I,  =  I,-m{a'-b').

Cor.   II. — The  M.  I.  has  the  same  value  for  all  parallel axes  at  the  same  distance  from  the  centroid.
5922  Theorem,  III. — The  iiroduct  of  inertia  for  two  assigned axes  is  equal  to  the  product  for  two  parallel  axes  through  the centroid  of  the  body  plus  the  product  taken  for  the  whole mass  collected  at  the  centroid  with  respect  to  the  assigned axes.
Proof. — Let  x  =  x  +  x',  y  =  y  +  y'  he  the  coordinates  of  an  element  of  the body  with  respect  to  the  assigned  axes ;  ^,  y  being  the  coordinates  of  the centroid,   and  x',   y'  the   coordinates  of  the  same  element  with  respect  to parallel  axes  through  the  centroid,  all  axes  being  parallel  to  z.     Then "Lmxy  =  ^in  (x  +  x')(ij  +  y')  =  d-y'S,m+'S:,mx'y' +  xl.my' +  yllmx' =  xyl^ni+'Simx'y'. Since  Swa;'  and  ^my'  vanish  by  the  definition  of  the  centroid.
5923  The  M.  I.  of  a  body  with  respect  to  a  point  is  equal to  the  M.  I.  for  any  plane  through  the  point  plus  the  M.  I. about  the  normal  to  the  plane  through  the  point.
Proof. — For  the  origin  and  yz  plane,

Then  the  M.  1.  about  OM =  ^m  (OP' -  OM')  =  %m  {  {x'  +  2/H z'){l'  +  m"  +  n^)  -{Ix  +  viy  +  nzf  ]     (5530) producing  the  above  result,  by  (5908-13).

obtained  by  putting  Ir^  =  71ft*.  M  being  the  mass  of  the  body, and  £*  a  constant  to  make  the  equation  homogeneous.  Hence  the square  of  the  radiuf^  of  the  momental  cllip><oidfor  anijiwint  varies inversely  as  the  moment  of  inertia  of  the  body  about  that  radius.

MOMENTAL  ELLIPSE.
5953  If  a,  i3  be  the  radii  of  gyration  of  a  plane  area  to principal  axes  Ox,  Oy,  where  0  is  the  centroid,  the  equation of  the  momental  ellipse  for  the  point  0  will  be

and  the  two  systems  have  the  same  centroid ;  therefore

Eliminating  x',  y',  x",  y"  between  the  five  equations,  we  find  the  equation  of (5953)  for  the  locus  of  xy.
5955     The  momental  ellipse  for  the  centroid  of  a  triangle  is the  inscribed  ellipse  touching  the  sides  at  their  mid-points.

Now  Di^  is  parallel  to  AG,  the  tangent  at  E  ;  therefore  BE,  which bisects  DF,  passes  through  the  centre  0  of  the  ellipse.  Similarly,  AT) passes  through  it;  therefore  0  is  the  centroid  of  the  triangle.

Hence  the  M.  I.  about  OD,  OE,  OF  varies  inversely  as  the  squares  of  those lines,  and  therefore  the  ellipse  in  the  diagram  is  a  momental  ellipse,  since  it has  six  points  which  fulfil  the  requirements.

822  SOLID  GEOMETRY.
Let  0  be  a  datum  point  in  the  line.  Take  this  for  origin, the  given  line  for  axis  of  z,  and  OX,  OY  for  the  other  axes. Then,  if  h  be  the  distance  from  0  to  the  required  point  0', and  0  the  angle  between  OX  and  the  principal  axis  O'X',

Proof.— At  the  point  0,  0,  //,  ^m  (z-h)  x  =  Xm  (z-h)y  =  0,  from which  h  is  found  ;  and  the  equation  for  6  is  that  for  determining  the  prin- cipal axes  of  the  elliptic  section  of  the  momental  ellipsoid,  whose  equation is  Ax^  +  2Hxy  +  B7/  =  Me*,  as  in  (4408).
5964  The  equality  of  the  two  ratios  in  (5961)  is  the  condi- tion that  the  ,^■  axis  should  be  a  principal  axis  at  some  point  of its  length.
5965  If  an  axis  be  a  principal  axis  at  more  than  one  point of  its  length,  it  passes  through  the  centroid  of  the  system; and,  conversely,  if  it  be  a  principal  axis  at  the  centroid,  it  is so  at  every  point  of  its  length.
Proof. — For  h  mnst  be  indeterminate  in  (5901).  Therefore  2myz  =  0, I,my  =  0,   "^.mzx  =  0,   SjHic  =  0.

The  internal  and  external  bisectors  of  the  angle  8r8'  will  be two  of  the  princi[)al  axes  at  /',  and  the  third  will  be  the  normal to  the  plane.
MOMENTS  OF  INERTIA.  823
Proof. — The  X  and  Y  principal  moments  being  equal  at  *S',  the  moment about  every  line  through />'  in  this  plane  is  the  same.  [For  I  =  Al'  +  Bm'^ +  Gn^  and  n  =  0  and  A  =  B,  therefore  I  =  vl.]  Therefore  the  moments about  8F  and  8'P  are  equal.  Therefore  the  bisectors  PT,  PG  of  the  angles at  P  will  be  principal  axes.
5968  Let  8Y,  8'Y'  be  the  perpendiculars  on  PT,  and  8Z, S'Z'  those  upon  PG ;  then  the  M.  I.  about  PT  and  PG  will  be respectively,

Similarly  for  the  M.  I.  about  PG.
5969  Hence,  if  an  elhpse  or  hyperbola  be  described  with S,  S'  for  foci,  the  tangent  and  normal  at  any  point  of  the curve  are  principal  axes,  and  the  M.  I.  about  either  is  constant for  that  curve.
5970  Similarly,  for  a  point  P  in  amj  plane  through  the centroid  0,  it  may  be  shown  that  the  same  construction  will give  the  axes  Pf,  PG  about  which  the  product  of  inertia vanishes,  OX,  OY  being  the  axes  at  0  in  the  given  plane  about which  the  product  of  inertia  vanishes.
5971  The  condition  for  the  existence  of  a  point  in  a  body at  which  the  M.  I.  about  every  axis  through  it  shall  be  the same,  is —
There  must  be  two  princifal  axes  of  equal  moment  at  the centroid,  and  the  M.  I.  aljout  each  must  he  less  than  the  third principal  moment.
Two  such  points  will  then  exist  situated  on  the  axis  of unequal  moment,  and  equi-distant  from  the  centroid.

Let  A,  B,  G  be  the  given  principal  moments,  and  let  the mass  of  the  body  be  unity.  Then  the  ellipsoid  of  gyration  at the  centroid  0,  and  a  quadric  confocal  with  it,  will  be

The  normal  to  the  confocal  ellipsoid  is the  axis  of  least  moment,  and  the  normal  to  the  two-fold hyperboloid  is  the  axis  of  greatest  moment.
Proof. — Draw  any  other  plane  through  P.  The  perpendicular  on  it from  0  is  less  than  the  perpendicular  on  the  parallel  tangent  plane  to  the confocal  ellipse,  and  greater  in  the  case  of  the  two-fold  hyperbola.  Then, by  (5921).

5980  Observe  that  ds  may  be  changed  into  dx,  dy,  or  dO by  the  substitution  formulae  (5113,  '16).
5981  For  a  plane  area  bounded  by  the  coordinate  axes,  the ordinate  y  and  the  curve  y  =f(^x),  the  M.  I.  about  the  x  and 2/  axes  are

The  ratio  of  tlie  difference  of  two  FagnaDian  arcs  on  the ellipse  to  the  difference  of  the  two  corresponding  arcs  on  the hyperbola  is  equal  to  the  product  of  e'-  and  the  four  abscissae of  the  points  on  the  ellipse.
SECTOR  AND  SEGMENT  OF  ELLIPSE.
6097  The  formulae  for  the  sector  and  segment  of  a  circle may  be  adapted  to  the  ellipse  by  writing  a  for  r  and  multi- plying linear  dimensions  parallel  to  the  minor  axis  by  b  :  a. But  a  will  then  represent  the  eccentric  angle  of  the  semi-arc, and  B  twice  that  angle.  Thus,  in  the  figure  of  (1205),  if AGP  be  the  half  sector,  a  =  AGp,  0  =  2AGp.

153  —
The
suffix  means  that  three  articles  under
the  same
heading  zcill  be  found  in  the  volume
-2 1 . — Means  that  one  article  on  the  subject  xvill  be  found  in  each  of  the  four  consecutive  volumes.
References  to  the  Synopsis  stand  first,  and  are  tlie  numbers  of  Articles, not  of  Pages.    An  asterisk  (*)  is  prefixed  where  such  numbers  ^vill  be  found.
The  unclassified  references  following  a  principal  title  commonly  refer  to papers  on  the  general  theory  of  the  subject ;  but  some  papers  are  occa- sionally included  amongst  these  of  which  the  titles  are  too  long  for  inser- tion, and  do  not  admit  of  abbreviation.
Subjects  which  might  well  have  been  included  under  the  same  head- ing appear  sometimes  under  dili'erent  ones,  for  the  folloAving  reasons : — Exigencies  of  space  have  decided  the  insertion  of  the  number  of  the  volume only  of  the  particular  work  in  question,  and  a  subsequent  examination  of the  Index  of  that  volume  is  required  in  order  to  find  the  page.  It,  thej'e- fore,  became  desirable  not  to  change  the  original  title  of  the  pa]>er  when there  was  danger,  by  so  doing,  of  making  it  unrecognizable.  When,  how- ever, the  same  subject  appears  in  two  parts  of  this  Index  under  different names,  cross  references  from  one  to  the  other  are  given.  Some  changes, however,  have  been  made  when  tlic  syiinnyin  was  perfectly  obvious  ;  for instance,  when  a  reference  to  a  journal,  ])n1)Iisli('(l  fifty  years  ago,  is  found under  the  Invading  of  "  Binary  Quantics,"  tlic  aclnal  title  of  tlio  ai'ticle  will, in  all  i)rol)ability,  be  "  Homogeneous  Kiiiict  ions  of  Two  Variables,"  and  so in  a  few  otlier  iiistiuices.
